Accessed 2025.", "formatted_answer": "Question: What are the most relevant language models used for chemistry?\n\nSeveral language models have emerged as significant tools in the field of chemistry, each addressing various challenges and applications. Notable models include Text2Mol and MolT5, which integrate natural language with molecular representations, facilitating the retrieval of molecules through text queries and generating molecular captions from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) (Caldas2024 pages 23-24). \n\nOther important models are Tag-LLM, which adapts general-purpose LLMs for specialized chemical domains, and iufacGPT, designed for property prediction and molecule generation (Caldas2024 pages 50-51). Additionally, models like MaScQA, MaterialBERT, and BatteryBERT focus on specific tasks such as molecular property prediction and battery data enhancement (Caldas2024 pages 55-56). \n\nAttention-based neural networks and SMILES-BERT are also utilized for predicting molecular properties and chemical reactions (Caldas2024 pages 58-58). Furthermore, innovative approaches like a Teacher-Student model for multi-constraint molecular generation and text-guided models using diffusion techniques are enhancing data mining from chemical literature (Caldas2024 pages 66-67). These advancements illustrate the diverse applications of language models in improving knowledge extraction and predictive accuracy in chemistry.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
