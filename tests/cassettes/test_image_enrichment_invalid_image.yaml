        It''s especially important to document referential information such as figure/table
        numbers, labels, plot colors, or legends.\n\nText co-located with the media
        may be associated with other media or unrelated content, so do not just blindly
        quote referential information. The smaller the image, the more likely co-located
        text is unrelated. To restate, often the co-located text is several pages of
        content, so only use aspects relevant to accompanying image or table.\n\nHere''s
        a few failure mode with possible resolutions:\n- The media was a logo or icon,
        so the text is unrelated. In this case, briefly describe the media as a logo
        or icon, and do not mention other unrelated surrounding text.\n- The media was
        display type, so the text is probably unrelated. The display type can be spread
        over several lines. In this case, briefly describe the media as display type,
        and do not mention other unrelated surrounding text.\n- The media is a margin
        box or design element, so the text is unrelated. In this case, briefly describe
        the media as decorative, and do not mention other unrelated surrounding text.\n-
        The media came from a bad PDF read, so it''s garbled. In this case, describe
        the media as garbled, state why it''s considered garbled, and do not mention
        other unrelated surrounding text.\n- The media is a subfigure or a subtable.
        In this case, make sure to only detail the subfigure or subtable, not the entire
        figure or table. Do not mention other unrelated surrounding text.\n\nHere is
        the co-located text from a radius of 1 page:\n\nSome text\n\nDescribe the media,
