          4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors:
          Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt
          to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how
          it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments
          of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic
          relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between
          the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified
          after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the \u2018Pak-China Friendship
          Year\u2019. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states
          with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic
          prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer.
          The roads and other communication link under this project will become source
          of cultural flow between the two states. Keyswords: China, CPEC, Culture,

          Comparing the Stardom of Prime Minister(s) of Pakistan, UK and India Authors:
          Maryam Waqas Mudassar Hussain Shah Saima Kausar Abstract: Political setup
          demands to use Twittersphere for preserving its reputation because of significant
          twitter audience, which follows celebrities and political figures. In this
          perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political
          as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom
          status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their
          fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level
          of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter,
          text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets
          contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for
          evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and
          PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet
          is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of
          negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are
          demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries
          i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India,
          Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed
          in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these
          political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson
          and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make
          significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures
          are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed
          that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal
          reputation. Keyswords: Imran Khan, Johnson Boris, Narendra Modi, Political

          Relationship between Government Size and Economic Growth of Pakistan in the
          Presence of Different Budget Uncertainty Measures Authors: Sunila Jabeen Dr.
          Wasim Shahid Malik Abstract: Relationship between government size and economic
          growth has always been a debated issue all over the world since the formative
          work of Barro (1990). However, this relationship becomes more questionable
          when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence
          on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget
          uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying
          on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of
          measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending
          is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time
          series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients
          from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative
          effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan
          regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long
          run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending
          in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close
          to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced.
          Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation
          method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan.
          Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the
          fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the
          long run. Keyswords: Budget Uncertainty, Economic Growth, Government Size,

          The Alchemist by Ben Jonson Authors: Dr. Fatima Syeda Dr. Faiza Zaheer Numrah
          Mehmood Abstract: This research aims to challenge the assumption that The
          Alchemist by Ben Jonson is one of the greatest examples of the \u201cexplicit
          mirth and laughter\u201d (Veneables 86). The paper argues that The Alchemist
          is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for
          a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis
          of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to
          determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist
          and in an attempt to \u201cbetter men\u201d (Prologue. 12) he becomes more
          satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends
          that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical,
          stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times. Keyswords: Comedy,

          approach have been extracted on the basis of in-depth interviews with security
          agencies and policymakers to understand the real time needs. The current research
          employs mixed method approach. Process Tracing is employed in this research
          to comprehend the causal mechanism behind the contemporary issue of border
          management system. A detailed statistical analysis of prospect outcomes has
          been given to validate the implication of CBM. Implication range of CBM has
          been discussed with positive and probably negative impacts due to its wide
          range of significance. This research gives an analysis of feasibility support
          to exercise CBM in best interest of the state and secure future of the region.

          vs. Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad): A Perspective of a Game Theory
          Authors: Muhammad Atif Prof. Dr. Muqarrab Akbar Abstract: Containment is the
          central part of the U.S.''s foreign policy during the cold war. With the application
          of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics.
          Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international
          politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative
          (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve
          support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In
          2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through
          Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China.
          The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the
          United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research
          with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both
          plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this
          study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics.
          This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the

          Modi a Machiavellian Prince: An Appraisal Authors: Dr. Imran Khan Dr. Karim
          Haider Syed Muhammad Yousaf Abstract: The comparison of Narendra Modi and
          Machiavellian Prince is very important as policies of Modi are creating problems
          within India and beyond the borders. The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli
          a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies
          as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered
          in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political
          leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of
          how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position
          that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of
          this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi\u2019s
          success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This
          article analyzed Narendra Modi''s policies and strategies to develop an analogy
          between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political
          strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest

          Godot as a Political Comedy Authors: Muhammad Umer Azim Dr. Muhammad Saleem
          Nargis Saleem Abstract: This study was devised to analyze Samuel Beckett\u2019s
          play Waiting for Godot in the light of Jean-Francois Lyotard\u2019s theory
          of postmodernism given in his book The Postmodern Condition (1984). This Lyotardian
          paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have
          been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world
          for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates
          a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully
          questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times.
          Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is
          a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature.
          There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic
          writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy
          is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry
          is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his
          artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success.
          It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art
          and message. Keyswords: Beckett, Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition, Waiting

          Uzma Shahzadi Abstract: The study intended to find out the effect of parenting
          styles on students\u2019 academic achievement. Current study was quantitative
          in nature. All elementary level enrolled students at government schools in
          the province of the Punjab made the population of the study. Multistage sampling
          was used to select the sample from four districts of one division (Sargodha)
          of the Punjab province i.e., Sargodha. A sample size i.e., n=960; students
          and their parents were participated in this study. Research scales i.e. Parenting
          Styles Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ) was adapted to analyze and measure parents\u2019
          parenting styles and an achievement test was developed to measure the academic
          achievement of the elementary students. After pilot testing, reliability coefficient
          Cronbach Alpha values for PSDQ and achievement test were 0.67 and 0.71 Data
          was collected and analyzed using frequencies count, percentages, mean scores
          and one way ANOVA. Major findings of the study were; Majority of the parents
          had authoritative parental style, a handsome number of parents keep connection
          of warmth and support with their children, show intimacy, focus on discipline,
          do not grant autonomy to their children, do not indulge with their children
          and as well as a handsome number of students were confident during their studies
          and study, further, found that parental style had positive relationship with
          academic achievement. Recommendations were made on the basis of findings and
          conclusion such as arrangement of Parents Teachers Meetings (PTM\u2018s),
          parents\u2019 training, provision of incentives and facilities to motivate
          families might be an inclusive component of elementary education program.

          Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and
          India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear
          warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two,
          the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing
          border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented
          anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and
          Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade
          ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue
          despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded
          heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators\u2019 demand for sovereignty and
          revocation of \u2018Special Status\u2019 of Kashmir impacting the stability

          Image of China in the Diplomatic Discourse: A Critical Discourse Analysis
          Authors: Muhammad Afzaal Muhammad Ilyas Chishti Abstract: The present study
          hinges on the major objective of analyzing Pakistani and Indian diplomatic
          discourses employed in portrayal of image of China. Data comprises the official
          discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive
          investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis
          propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia\u2019s
          (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded
          priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature
          of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely
          different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective
          of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment
          of linguistic techniques of \u2018positivity\u2019, \u2018evasion\u2019 and
          \u2018influence and power\u2019, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise
          over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan\u2019s
          already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani
          diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their
          already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC,
          BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment
          of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation
          of the diplomatic relations with China. Keyswords: CDA, China Image, Corpus,

          Perception about Academic Advising Satisfaction at Higher Education Level
          Authors: Rukhsana Sardar Zarina Akhtar Shamsa Aziz Abstract: The purpose of
          the study was to examine the students\u2019 perception about academic advising
          satisfaction at higher education level. All the students from two years master
          (M.A) degree programme and four years (BS) degree programme of eight departments
          from International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), Faculty of Social
          Sciences were taken as a population of the study. 475 students were randomly
          selected as a sample of the study. The Academic Advising Inventory (AAI) was
          used to assess Academic Advising Style. For measuring level of the satisfaction,
          descriptive statistics was used. To compare the mean difference department-wise
          and gender-wise about academic advising satisfaction t.test was applied. It
          was concluded that from the major findings of the study those students who
          received departmental academic advising style are more satisfied as compared
          to those students who provided prescriptive academic advising style. Female
          students seemed more satisfied as compared to male students regarding the
          academic advising style provided to them. Students who satisfied from developmental
          academic advising style and they were also highly satisfied from the advising
          provided to them at Personalizing Education (PE) and this is the subscale
          of developmental academic advising whereas students who received prescriptive
          academic advising they were also satisfied from the advising provided to them
          regarding personalizing education and academic decision making but their percentage
          is less. It is recommended to Universities Administration to focus on Developmental
          Academic Advising Style and establish centers at universities/department level
          and nominate staff who may be responsible to provide developmental academic
          advising. Keyswords: Academic Advising, Higher Level, Students\u2019 Perception

          Dr. Subha Malik Nayab Javed Abstract: Sexual harassment is a social issue
          which is present in every society, globally, which interferes in an individual\u2019s
          social and professional life. It happens almost everywhere i.e. at workplaces,
          public places or institutes as well. The focus of the present study was to
          explore the differences of male and female students\u2019 perception of sexual
          harassment. This study was a quantitative research. Sample of the study included
          of 400 students (200 males and 200 females) from two government and two private
          universities. In the present study, Sexual Harassment Perception Questionnaire
          (SHPQ) was used to find out these differences in perceptions as every person
          has his own view for different situations. The study revealed the significant
          differences in perception of students. Study showed that both genders perceived
          that female students get more harassed than male students. The factors that
          affect the perception frequently were gender and age. The findings recommended
          that regulations for sexual harassment should be implemented in universities;
          laws should be made for sexual harassment in higher education institutes.
          Students should be aware of sexual harassment through seminars, self-defense
          classes and awareness campaigns. And every institute should have a counseling
          center for the better mental health of students. Keyswords: Gender Differences,

          Prospects of Cooperation between India and Pakistan Authors: Sarah Saeed Prof.
          Dr. Rana Eijaz Ahmad Abstract: Climate change is transforming the global societies.
          The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health,
          food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate,
          water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty.
          This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the
          water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation
          between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin.
          Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on
          the \u2018Theory of the International Regimes\u2019. It has been argued that
          institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any
          water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member
          states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus
          Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement
          in managing the negative consequences of the climate change. Keyswords: Climate

          Saima Saeed Farah Malik Suzanne Bartle Haring Abstract: Measuring differentiation
          of self in terms of behavioral/emotional reactivity towards parents is important
          because of the complex parent-child connection. This needs a valid and reliable
          measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship
          with parents. Behavior\\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills
          this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate
          BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu
          version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken
          from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father
          forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original
          factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis
          showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (\u03b1= .91 to \u03b1=.80).
          BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with
          parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference
          between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable
          measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions
          to work with adolescents. Keyswords: Adolescence, Differentiation of Self,

          A Comparative Analysis of Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse Authors: Khadija
          Naz Abstract: One of the fundamental issues for modern civilized man is how
          to adapt a modern society without losing his individual status. Is it possible
          for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality
          and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to
          flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary
          for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given
          questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century
          thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first
          the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse
          will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development
          of modern society. Keyswords: Modern Society, Performance Principle, Repression,

          Abstract: The current study was aimed to explore TPACK skills of prospective
          teachers and challenges faced in digital technology integration in Pakistan.
          The study was qualitative in nature and semi structured interview schedule
          was developed to collect data from prospective teachers. Purposive sampling
          technique was employed to collect data from 20 prospective teachers of 7 public
          sector universities. It was concluded that majority of the prospective teachers
          used general technological and pedagogical practices (GTPP), technological
          knowledge practices (TKP), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge practices (TPKP),
          Technological Content Knowledge practices (TCKP). Majority of prospective
          teachers reported multiple challenges in integration of digital technology
          in teacher education programs including lack of teacher training as one of
          the largest hurdle in digital technology integration, lack of digital technology
          resources or outdated digital technology resources, inadequate computer lab,

          the Linkage between Money Supply and Income: A Simultaneous Equation Model
          for Pakistan Authors: Zenab Faizullah Dr. Shahid Ali Muhammad Imad Khan Abstract:
          A reliable estimate of the money supply is an important sign of the Gross
          Domestic Product (GDP) and many other macroeconomic indicators. It is widely
          discussed that over a long period of time, there is a strong link between
          GDP and money supply. This link is significantly important for formation of
          monetary policy. The main aim of this study is to estimate the income-money
          supply model for Pakistan. This study estimates the income-money supply model
          for Pakistan over the period of 2009 to 2019. The study uses Two Stage Least
          Square (2SLS) econometric technique due to the presence of endogeneity problem
          in the model under consideration. The existence of simultaneity between money
          supply (M2) and income (GDP) is also clear from the results of Hausman Specification
          test for simultaneity between M2 and GDP. The results further show that there
          exists a strong money-income relationship in case of Pakistan. Keyswords:

          the Mechanism of Language Learning Process by the Use of Language Learning
          Strategies Authors: Shafiq Ahmad Farooqi Dr. Muhammad Shakir Sher Muhammad
          Awan Abstract: This analytical research study involves the use of learning
          strategies to know the mechanism of learning a second language. People acquire
          their native language (L1) without any conscious effort and they have a complete
          knowledge of L1 and are competent in their native language even without going
          to school. It is believed that language learning is a process as well as an
          outcome and the focus of current study is to understand the process of learning
          a second language. The population in this study comprised of 182 boys and
          Girls Govt. Higher Secondary Schools studying at intermediate level in the
          11 Districts of the Southern Punjab. The sample was selected through random
          probability sampling and consisted of 40 subject specialists teaching the
          subject of English in Govt. higher secondary schools with 400 students studying
          English at Intermediate level. A questionnaire comprising some common and
          easily accessible learning strategies was designed to determine the frequency
          of these strategies used in the classrooms by the language learners through
          the specialists of the subject. The data was collected from the selected sample
          through the subject specialists teaching in these schools. The data was collected
          quantitatively and was analyzed in the statistical package for social sciences
          (SPSS) version 20. The most common 27 language learning strategies (LLS) were
          applied to analyze the process of language learning. In the light of the results
          of the study, it was concluded that application of the learning strategies
          according to the nature of the text is helpful in understanding the language
          functions and its application. Keyswords: Language Acquisition, Learning Strategies,

          Dr. Naima Qureshi Abstract: In the National curriculum policy documents, to
          produce rationale and independent critical thinkers, different pedagogical
          practices have been recommended like cooperative learning, questioning, discussion,
          etc. This qualitative case study aimed at analyzing secondary school science
          teachers\u2019 practices for the development of critical thinking skills in
          secondary school students. There were twelve classrooms (four from each subject
          of Physics, Chemistry and Biology) selected as cases. Video recording was
          used for the observations for six lessons in each classroom. In this way,
          a total of 72 observations were conducted lasting for approximately 35 minutes.
          Qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis through Nvivo 12.
          The findings of the observations revealed that all the teachers used the lecture
          method. They used this to cover the content at a given specific time. There
          was not much focus on the development of critical thinking. In a few of the
          classrooms, the students were engaged and active during learning different
          specific topics. Whiteboard was used as a visual aid by most of the teachers.
          Furthermore, to some extent, discussion, questioning, and daily life examples
          were used in different classrooms. It is recommended that teachers\u2019 professional
          development should be conducted to focus on the development of critical thinking

          of the authority from central units of empowering authorities to the local
          level to develop and exercise policies at local or organizational level is
          under debate in various countries of the world. The legation in with the name
          of 18th constitutional amendment in constitution of 1973 of Pakistan ensures
          more autonomy to federal units. The difference between province and federation
          mostly creates misunderstanding in the belief of cooperation and universalism
          of education standards, expenditures and service delivery. Very currently

          of Evidence Collected by Modern Devices: A Case Study Authors: Muhammad Hassan
          Zia Alvina Ali Abstract: This paper is a qualitative research of different
          case laws dealing with modern technological evidence. Courts were required
          to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement
          of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern
          technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences
          and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern
          times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility
          of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist
          the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain
          criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence
          admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were
          resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence
          have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed
          in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing.
          The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases
          statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must
          be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to
          come to the Court. Nevertheless, it has some problems. The most important
          among them is the identification of the witness and an assurance that he is
          not being prompted when his statement is recorded. In this paper protocols
          that are necessary to follow while examining witness through video link are
          discussed Keyswords: DNA Profiling, Finger Prints, , Telephone Calls, Video

          were evaluated. The findings of the study revealed that reading comprehension
          questions in English textbook for grade 10 were solely based on remembering
          level (100%) whereas the questions in Oxford Progressive English 10 were mainly
          based on understanding level (75.5%) with a small percentage of remembering
          (12.5%), analyzing (11.1%) and evaluating level (0.74%). This suggests that

          of Reasoning Skills among Prospective Teachers through Cognitive Acceleration
          Approach Authors: Memoona Bibi Dr. Shamsa Aziz Abstract: The main objectives
          of this study were to; investigate the effects of the Cognitive Acceleration
          approach on the reasoning skills of the prospective teachers at the university
          level and compare the effects of the Cognitive Acceleration approach and traditional
          approach concerning reasoning skills of prospective teachers\u2019 at the
          university level. The study was experimental and followed a pre-test post-test
          control group experimental design. The sample of the study included the experimental
          group and control group from the BS Education program in the Department of
          Education at International Islamic University Islamabad. A simple random sampling
          technique was used to select the sample after pre-test and pairing of prospective
          teachers. CTSR (classroom test for scientific reasoning) developed by A.E.
          Lawson (2000) was used to collect the data through pre-tests and post-tests.
          The experimental group\u2019s perception about different activities of the
          experiment was taken through a self-made rating scale. Collected data were
          analyzed by calculating mean scores and t-test for hypothesis testing by using
          SPSS. The main findings of the study revealed that the Cognitive Acceleration
          teaching approach has a significant positive effect on the reasoning skills
          development of prospective teachers at the university level. Findings also
          showed that participants found this teaching approach effective and learned
          many new concepts and skills with the help of thinking activities. Based on
          findings it has been concluded that the Cognitive Acceleration teaching approach
          might be encouraged for training prospective teachers at the university level
          and training sessions about the use of the Cognitive Acceleration approach
          must be arranged by teacher education programs and institutions. Keyswords:

          Kartography Authors: Syeda Hibba Zainab Zaidi Dr. Ali Usman Saleem Sadia Waheed
          Abstract: Social space under postmodernism and wave of globalization have
          suffered in and its idealistic representations are lost and deteriorated which
          ultimately led to discursiveness in the lives of postmodern man, especially
          Karachiites. The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping
          fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories
          of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja,
          argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within
          the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal
          happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a
          part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre\u2019s
          idea of spatial triad and Soja\u2019s views of the trialectrics of spaciality,
          this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves
          for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban
          space. Using Shamsie\u2019s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary
          urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing
          in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation
          on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research
          substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social
          values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the
          lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial
          Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist
          era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced
          spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation,
          especially Karachiites. Keyswords: Capitalistic Hegemony, City Space, Globalization,

          Learning (MALL). This paper aims to fill the gap of MALL research in the area
          of grammar teaching in the Pakistan. Two BS Part 1 classes from University
          of Sindh, Jamshoro, were chosen for this quasi-experimental study. In total,
          62 out of 101 students volunteered to use the Hello English application for
          2 months, making up the experiment group, and the remaining 39 students were
          put in a control group. Paired Samples T-Test was run on pretest and posttest
          results which revealed no significant difference in both groups\u2019 performances,
          proving that Hello English application could not significantly improve students\u2019
          grammar performance. However, in spite of the lack of a significant difference
          between the test results, the data gathered through the attitudinal survey
          showed that students still found mobile application very easy to use and effective

          foremost purpose of this research paper was to interrogate the effects of
          determinants on the educational and social profile of secondary school teachers
          in Pakistan. The key question taken was related to determinants that affect
          teachers\u2019 profile. The Population of the study was secondary school teachers
          of Punjab province. A questionnaire was used as research instrument. The researcher
          personally visited the schools to administer the questionnaire. E-Views software
          was used for data analysis. Moreover, OLS regression model and LOGIT regression
          model were carried out. It was found that the variable years of teaching experience
          (EXPYR) (*** 0.03) can have a vital concrete effect upon the societal figuration
          of teachers as the experience of teachers grows, so does their social interactions
          with officials, colleagues, students and friends increases. The said variable
          is significant at 10 percent level. The variable, Residence (RESIDE) (** 0.53)
          have a significant impact upon civic links. This obviously associated with
          less community connection of country side teachers than the teachers residing

          Construction in Akhtar\u2019s Melody of a Tear Authors: Dr. Amna Saeed Hina
          Quddus Abstract: This study aims to discuss the notion of gender in terms
          of performativity and social construction. It also draws upon the idea of
          gender identity construction and how it relates to the society, performativity
          and biology. As its theoretical framework, the study relies upon the Performative
          Theory of Gender and Sex (1990) presented by Judith Butler and studies the
          gender identity construction in the female protagonist of Akhtar\u2019s Melody
          of a Tear. Zara is a girl who is raised as a boy from his father and there
          is a kind of dilemma in Zara\u2019s personality related to being masculine
          and feminine. The cultural norms of a particular gender are also a cause of
          this dilemma. Throughout the novel, she is in a conflicting state whether
          she should behave feminine or masculine. She is being depicted as an incomplete
          person until she finds and resolves this issue of gender identity. The paper
          discusses the gender performativity, social construction, cultural norms and
          identity as these are all contributing to the confusion and construction of
          the protagonist\u2019s identity. Character analysis is used as the methodology

          meth use is pervading in our society. Present study was conducted to explore
          the relationship between level of impulsivity and aggression among crystal
          meth and cannabis users. The sample of the present study was comprised of
          100 participants. There were 50 cannabis and 50 crystal meth users who were
          diagnosed on the basis of DSM-V without any comorbidity. The sample were taken
          from all age range of population. The minimum education level was primary
          and maximum education level was graduation and above. The sample was selected
          from different drug rehabilitation centers of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan.
          Demographic Performa was used to collect the initial important information,
          The \u201cBarratt Impulsiveness Scale was used to measure the impulsivity
          and \u201cAggression Questionnaire\u201d were used to measure the level of
          aggression. Finding of the study showed that there are significant differences
          among crystal meth and cannabis users on level of aggression. The calculated
          mean value for crystal meth user and for cannabis users indicates that crystal
          meth users have higher level of aggression as compared to the cannabis user.
          Over all analysis indicates a significant positive correlation of impulsivity
          with the variable aggression. The alpha coefficient value for all scale is
          acceptable. Keyswords: Aggression, Cannabis Users, Crystal Meth, Impulsivity

          Irfan Iram Ramzan Abstract: This study seeks to investigate whether personality
          traits predict self-esteem and death anxiety among drug addicts. The sample
          consisted of 100 drug addicts taken from the two hospitals in Multan city.
          Only men between the ages of 20 and 65 were included in the study. Data was
          collected through reliable and valid questionnaires. Results revealed positive
          relationship between conscientiousness, openness to experience and self-esteem.
          Moreover, findings showed positive relationship between extraversion and death
          anxiety, and negative correlation between neuroticism and death anxiety. Findings
          also showed that self-esteem and death anxiety are significantly and negatively
          correlated. Additionally, findings revealed that conscientiousness positively
          predicted self-esteem and neuroticism negatively predicted death anxiety.
          Furthermore, significant differences were observed in self-esteem, and death
          anxiety based on age. Significant differences were also found in extraversion,
          agreeableness, openness to experience, and death anxiety based on location.

          prolong the interstate or civil wars with unending sufferings and devastations.
          The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars
          and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions,
          flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections,
          and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region.
          In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order
          for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power
          in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region.
          New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the \u2018status quo\u2019
          and \u2018counter-hegemonic\u2019 states along with their respective allies,
          made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex
          of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation
          of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the

          democratization and consolidation refers to the structure of democracy following
          the collapse of non-democratic regime. Ten factors as given by Michael J.

          It is argued in this research that the ten factors of democratization as given
          by Michael J. Sodaro have been absent in the political system of Pakistan
          and working on these factors can lead Pakistan to the road of democratization.

          Bukhari Ghani Rehman Abstract: This study focuses on the description and categorization
          of intransitive verbs in terms of its argument structure. The study concludes
          that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not
          require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by
          adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included
          in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative,
          on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument
          while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The
          event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require
          one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the
          external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets
          realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument.
          The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument
          and by the externalization of the internal argument. Keyswords: Argument Structure,

          The sample size of the study (i.e., 100 students) was explored using Taro
          Yamane\u2019 equation from the university of Okara, Punjab, Pakistan. The
          respondents were approached using simple random sampling and interviewed using
          face to face interview schedule. The data was collected using a structured
          questionnaire. The analysis was administered through SPSS-20.The study explored
          that parental illiteracy is associated with the high criminal and negative
          orientation of students towards beggars. It was also explored that females
          and respondents from rural background have low negative orientation towards
          beggars. However, males and respondents from urban background have medium
          criminal orientation and low positive orientation towards beggars, respectively.
          The study is useful for the government of Punjab, Pakistan campaign and policy
          for anti-begging. The study introduced the geometrical model of youth\u2019s
          orientation toward begging. The study also contributed to the literature on
          begging by extending its domain from Law and Criminology to sociology as it
          incorporated social variables e.g., parents\u2019 education, gender, etc.,
          to explore their association with the youth\u2019s socialization about begging.

          Amjad Rashid Abstract: Pakistan is located in a pivotal region. Its geo-strategic
          location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in
          South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent
          features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric
          state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance
          that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution
          of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of
          power but in reality Pakistan\u2019s army is the most powerful institution
          in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created
          institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources
          is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics
          is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national
          unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against
          the neighboring countries. Keyswords: Constitutionalism, Identity, Islam,

          Abstract: The countries of South Asian region have pluralistic societies with
          different language, religious, and ethnic identities. Pakistan is no exception
          who is facing the challenge of regionalism since its inception. Different
          ethnic groups have been consistently raising their voices for separatism or
          autonomy within the frame work of an existing territorial state. The issues
          of provincialism, ethnicity, and regionalism is posing a serious challenge
          to the integrity of the country. This paper aims to explore the causes of
          the regionalism in Pakistan and intends to analyze the policies and strategies
          of different political governments which they launched to tackle this all
          important issue. The paper follows the historical method of research and analyzes
          different types of qualitative data to conclude the finding of the research.
          The paper develops the theory of \u201cRegionalists Demand and Government
          Response\u201d which shows how different regionalist forces put their demands
          and how the governments react on these demands. It recommends the grant of
          greater regional autonomy to the regionalists to enhance internal security
          and to protect the country from disintegration. Keyswords: Demands, Ethnicity,

          Authors: Sabir Naz Abstract: Lahore is the provincial capital of Punjab, where
          a sizeable population of the Hindus has been residing there since the inception
          of Pakistan. There had been many crematoriums in the city but with the passage
          of time, one after another, disappeared from the land after partition of the
          Sub-continent. Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites.
          There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik
          Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of
          population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed
          by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court
          of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the
          city. The community remained deprived of a place to dispose of a dead body
          according to their faith for a long period which is contravention with the

          Growth Model by Non-Nested Encompassing: A Cross Country Analysis Authors:
          Benish Rashid Dr. Shahid Razzaque Dr. Atiq ur Rehman Abstract: Whether models
          are nested or non-nested it is important to be able to compare them and evaluate
          their comparative results. In this study six growth models have been used
          for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries,
          therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and
          nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980
          to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore,
          the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these
          different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these
          six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with
          the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating
          the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different
          sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic
          variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found
          that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with
          lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital
          formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic

          of Youth Buying Behaviour for Organic Food Products in Southern Punjab: Perceptions
          and Hindrances Authors: Ayousha Rahman Asif Yaseen Muhammad Arif Nawaz Abstract:
          This research examined the cognitive antecedental effects on organic food
          purchase behaviour for understanding the perceptions and hindrances associated
          with purchasing organic food products. Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was
          adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the
          two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were
          collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique
          was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic
          food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic
          food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship
          of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings
          highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that
          could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient
          environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government
          administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight
          the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

          Authors: Ashiq Hussain Asma Amanat Abstract: The worth and usefulness of English
          education as a foreign language is of great concern to language rule and planning
          (LRP) researchers compared to teaching their native language globally in higher
          education. The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar
          groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan.
          The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction
          (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI).
          An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered
          questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based
          knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding
          of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected
          group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information
          is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses.
          Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the
          overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction
          students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective.
          It explains the implications of the findings to continue the language rule

          Vonnegut\u2019s \u2018Happy Birthday Wanda Juny\u2019 and focuses on how both
          women and environment are exploited by patriarchy. Ecofeminism critiques masculine
          dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination,
          social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of
          power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men
          because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There
          is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other
          environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach
          to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging
          discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature.
          Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender
          categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise
          d\u2018Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation
          of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women
          and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance
          and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and
          protection of environment. Vonnegut\u2019s play \u2018Happy Birthday Wanda
          June\u2019 was written at a time when the movement for the right of women
          and protection of environment were gaining momentum. The play shows how toxic
          masculinity rooted in power and capitalism exploit both women and environment.

          of Quran, a sacred scripture of Islam- which specifically relates to social
          equity opportunities and a code of conduct in the context of economics. The
          Quran claims that it is a book which explains every situation; therefore,
          the aim of this study remained to extract those verses of Surah Al-Baqarah
          which can guide us in Economics. The authentic and approved Islamic clerics
          and their translations were consulted for the interpretations of the Holy
          verses. The researchers chiefly focused and studied Surah Baqarah with regards
          to social equity and economic opportunities. The translations were primarily
          in the regional language Urdu so the interpretations must not be related exactly
          equitable in English. The study engaged the document analysis research strategy.
          This study is only an endeavour to decipher Holy Quran\u2019s message from
          Allah for the mankind so it must not be considered as the full and complete
          solution to the all the economic issues, challenges and opportunities. Ahadees
          and the saying of the Holy prophet were referred to where ever required and
          available. The researcher also considered the Tafasir (detail intellectual
          interpretations) of the Quran done by the well-known scholars of Islam for
          the verses studied therein and any statements and/or material - such as ideas,
          studies, articles, documentation, data, reports, facts, statistics etc. For
          the study, data was collected and analyzed qualitatively. On the basis of

          and Cultural Consumption Authors: Rao Nadeem Alam Tayyaba Khalid Abstract:
          Semantics is about meanings and meanings are arbitrary and shared. Understanding
          qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning
          creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This
          interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective
          meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition,
          its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions
          which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated
          with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat.
          It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered
          and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due
          to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed
          people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample
          size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry

          and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong
          refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief
          that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either
          psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them
          how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this

          The Living Source for the Natives (A Case Study of Jiwani-Iran Border, Baluchistan)
          Authors: Abdul Raheem Dr. Ikram Badshah Wasia Arshed Abstract: This study
          explores the political economy of smuggling on Jiwani-Iran border. The natives
          are majorly involved in illegal transportation of goods and objects, therefore;
          the study sets to explain how significant smuggling for the local people is.
          It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation.
          The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were
          employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people
          were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their
          expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders. They disclosed that their
          total economy was predominantly based on smuggling of stuff like drugs, diesel,
          oil, gas, petrol, ration food from Iran, and human trafficking. They also
          enjoyed the privilege of possessing Sajjil (Iranian identity card), thus;
          the dual nationality helped them in their daily business and rahdari (border
          crossing agreement), enabling them to travel to Iran for multiple purposes.

          Kafkaesque Study of Kobo Abe\u2019s The Woman in the Dunes Authors: Imran
          Aslam Kainat Azhar Abstract: This paper analyses the Kafkaesque/Kafkan features
          of Kobo Abe\u2019s novel The Woman in the as formulated by Kundera in \u201cKafka\u2019s
          World.\u201d For Kundera, in a Kafkaesque work human existence is bleakly
          represented through intermingling of tragedy and comedy in an indifferent
          world dominated by hegemonic systems. The Kafkaesque is characterised by the
          following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man
          has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth
          makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man\u2019s
          land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from
          the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic
          despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present
          tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe\u2019s novel. The paper
          studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and
          the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom
          in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary
          world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives
          with a Kafkaesque touch. Keyswords: Authority, Institutions, Kafka, Kafkaesque,

          Hina Iqbal Dr. Muhammad Asif Asia Saeed Abstract: Louis Althusser\u2019s concept
          of interpellation is a process in which individuals internalize cultural values
          and ideology and becomes subject. Althusser believes that ideology is a belief
          system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in
          society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning.
          These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological
          agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable
          ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies
          are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture
          and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid\u2019s novel
          The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser\u2019s ideology and interpellation.
          This study examines how the characters of Shahid\u2019s novel inhaled ideology
          and became its subjects. This research also depicts the alarming effects of
          cultural hegemony that creates cultural infidelity and hierarchies between

          Policy in the Colonial Punjab Authors: Mohammad Dilshad Mohabbat Muhammad
          Hassan Muhammad Ayaz Rafi Abstract: Woods Education Despatch is considered
          to be the Magna Carta of Indian Education. It controlled the Indian education
          field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch
          provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government\u2019s gradual
          withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated
          the missionaries by offering system of \u2018grants on aid\u2019 to the private
          bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions
          in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their
          educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing
          more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the
          Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase
          of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century,
          they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality
          of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change
          of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also
          attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were
          taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following
          the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries\u2019
          autobiographies, Reports of missionaries\u2019 conferences, and the other
          relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories.
          The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration
          of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission
          were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries\u2019 educational
          policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy,
          worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

          Women Rights in Punjab Authors: Dr. Bushra Yasmeen Dr. Muhammad Ramzan Dr.
          Asma Seemi Malik Abstract: Dowry is a common tradition in south Asian countries,
          especially in Pakistan and India. Daughters became curses and liability for
          parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions
          (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993)
          on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been
          extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and
          trends of society. To understand males\u2019 and females\u2019 perceptions
          about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting
          women\u2019s rights and eventually affecting women\u2019s autonomy. A qualitative
          study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from
          males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples
          about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men\u2019s support, and
          perception against dowry especially with regards to women\u2019s rights and
          autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture,
          electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated
          with women\u2019s development and their rights. General people\u2019s perception
          showed that dowry is no longer remained a custom or tradition in Asian countries.
          It is just a trend and people follow it as a symbol of respect for parents
          and women as well. Keyswords: Dowry, Effects, Impacts Of Dowry, Perceptions,

          of Effective Governance: An analysis of Pakistan\u2019s Counter Strategy for
          Covid-19 as a Non-Traditional Security Challenge Authors: Dr. Iram Khalid
          Abstract: COVID -19 affected the world unprecedentedly. Lack of capacity and
          poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to
          Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response
          to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making
          theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective
          role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination
          of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level
          of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government\u2019s
          approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political
          and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant
          interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying
          the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use
          a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges.
          The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center;
          that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security
          challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness. Keyswords: COVID-19,

          pdf view article Creative Commons License Comparative Implications of Wednesbury
          Principle in England and Pakistan Authors: Safarat Ahmad Ali Shah Dr. Sara
          Qayum Arzoo Farhad Abstract: Wednesbury principle is one of the most important
          and useful grounds of the Judicial Review. Judicial review is a remedy provided
          by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise
          administrative authorities'' powers and functions. The main objective of the
          judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals
          by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness
          or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced
          by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the
          scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only
          in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human
          rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies
          and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its
          encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e.,
          the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle
          results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government.
          The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground
          of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies
          in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms
          on this ground of judicial review. Keyswords: Administrative Authorities,

          language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks across domains
          but struggle with chemistry-related problems. These models also lack access
          to external knowledge sources, limiting their usefulness in scientific applications.
          We introduce ChemCrow, an LLM chemistry agent designed to accomplish tasks
          across organic synthesis, drug discovery and materials design. By integrating
          18 expert-designed tools and using GPT-4 as the LLM, ChemCrow augments the
          LLM performance in chemistry, and new capabilities emerge. Our agent autonomously
          planned and executed the syntheses of an insect repellent and three organocatalysts
          and guided the discovery of a novel chromophore. Our evaluation, including
          both LLM and expert assessments, demonstrates ChemCrow\u2019s effectiveness
          in automating a diverse set of chemical tasks. Our work not only aids expert
          chemists and lowers barriers for non-experts but also fosters scientific advancement
          by bridging the gap between experimental and computational chemistry.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038\/s42256-024-00832-8","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,8]],"date-time":"2024-05-08T10:03:31Z","timestamp":1715162611000},"page":"525-535","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21,"title":["Augmenting
