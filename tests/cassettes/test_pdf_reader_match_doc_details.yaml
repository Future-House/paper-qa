      in using deep learning (DL) in decision making, due to\nthe lack of interpretability
      in \u201cblack-box\u201d models. Explainable artificial intelligence\n(XAI)
      is a branch of AI which addresses this drawback by providing tools to interpret\nDL
      models and their predictions. We review the principles of XAI in the domain
      of\nchemistry and emerging methods for creating and evaluating explanations.
      Then we\nfocus on methods developed by our group and their applications in predicting
      solubil-\nity, blood-brain barrier permeability, and the scent of molecules.
      We show that XAI\nmethods like chemical counterfactuals and descriptor explanations
      can explain DL pre-\ndictions while giving insight into structure-property relationships.
      Finally, we discuss\nhow a two-step process of developing a black-box model
      and explaining predictions can\nuncover structure-property relationships.\n1\nIntroduction\nDeep
      learning (DL) is advancing the boundaries of computational chemistry because
      it can\naccurately model non-linear structure-function relationships.1\u20133
      Applications of DL can be\nfound in a broad spectrum spanning from quantum computing4,5
      to drug discovery6\u201310 to\nmaterials design.11,12 According to Kre 13, DL
      models can contribute to scientific discovery\nin three \u201cdimensions\u201d
      - 1) as a \u2018computational microscope\u2019 to gain insight which are not\nattainable
      through experiments 2) as a \u2018resource of inspiration\u2019 to motivate
      scientific thinking\n3) as an \u2018agent of understanding\u2019 to uncover
      new observations. However, the rationale of\na DL prediction is not always apparent
      due to the model architecture consisting a large\nparameter count.14,15 DL models
      are thus often termed\u201cblack box\u201d models. We can only\nreason about
      the input and output of an DL model, not the underlying cause that leads to\na
      specific prediction.\nIt is routine in chemistry now for DL to exceed human
      level performance \u2014 humans are\nnot good at predicting solubility from
      structure for example161 \u2014 and so understanding how\na model makes predictions
      can guide hypotheses. This is in contrast to a topic like finding\na stop sign
      in an image, where there is little new to be learned about visual perception\nby
      explaining a DL model. However, the black box nature of DL has its own limitations.\nUsers
      are more likely to trust and use predictions from a model if they can understand
      why\nthe prediction was made.17 Explaining predictions can help developers of
      DL models ensure\nthe model is not learning spurious correlations.18,19 Two
      infamous examples are, 1)neural\nnetworks that learned to recognize horses by
      looking for a photogr", "o infamous examples are, 1)neural\nnetworks that learned
      to recognize horses by looking for a photographer\u2019s watermark20 and,\n2)
      neural networks that predicted a COVID-19 diagnoses by looking at the font choice\non
      medical images.21 As a result, there is an emerging regulatory framework for
      when any\ncomputer algorithms impact humans.22\u201324 Although we know of no
      examples yet in chemistry,\none can assume the use of AI in predicting toxicity,
      carcinogenicity, and environmental\npersistence will require rationale for the
      predictions due to regulatory consequences.\n1there does happen to be one human
      solubility savant, participant 11, who matched machine performance\n2\nEXplainable
      Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a field of growing importance that aims to\nprovide
      model interpretations of DL predictions Three terms highly associated with XAI
      are,\ninterpretability, justifications and explainability. Miller 25 defines
      that interpretability of a\nmodel refers to the degree of human understandability
      intrinsic within the model. Murdoch\net al. 26 clarify that interpretability
      can be perceived as \u201cknowledge\u201d which provide insight\nto a particular
      problem.\nJustifications are quantitative metrics tell the users \u201cwhy the\nmodel
      should be trusted,\u201d like test error.27 Justifications are evidence which
      defend why a\nprediction is trustworthy.25 An \u201cexplanation\u201d is a description
      on why a certain prediction was\nmade.9,28 Interpretability and explanation
      are often used interchangeably. Arrieta et al. 14\ndistinguish that interpretability
      is a passive characteristic of a model, whereas explainability\nis an active
      characteristic which is used to clarify the internal decision-making process.\nNamely,
      an explanation is extra information that gives the context and a cause for one
      or\nmore predictions.29 We adopt the same nomenclature in this perspective.\nAccuracy
      and interpretability are two attractive characteristics of DL models. However,\nDL
      models are often highly accurate and less interpretable.28,30 XAI provides a
      way to avoid\nthat trade-off in chemical property prediction. XAI can be viewed
      as a two-step process.\nFirst, we develop an accurate but uninterpretable DL
      model. Next, we add explanations to\npredictions. Ideally, if the DL model has
      correctly learned the input-output relations, then\nthe explanations should
      give insight into the underlying mechanism.\nIn the remainder of this article,
      we review recent approaches for XAI of chemical property\nprediction while drawing
      specific examples from our recent XAI work.9,10,31 We show how\nin various systems
      these methods yield explanations that are consistent with known and\nmechanisms
      in structure-property relationships.\n3\nTheory\nIn this work, we aim to assemble
      a common taxonomy for the landscape of XAI while\nproviding our perspectives.
      We utilized the vocabulary proposed by Das and Rad 32 to classify\nXAI. According
      to their classification, interpretations can be categorized as global or local\ninterpretations
      on the basis of \u201cwhat ", "cation, interpretations can be categorized as
      global or local\ninterpretations on the basis of \u201cwhat is being explained?\u201d.
      For example, counterfactuals are\nlocal interpretations, as these can explain
      only a given instance. The second classification is\nbased on the relation between
      the model and the interpretation \u2013 is interpretability post-hoc\n(extrinsic)
      or intrinsic to the model?.32,33 An intrinsic XAI method is part of the model\nand
      is self-explanatory32 These are also referred to as white-box models to contrast
      them\nwith non-interpretable black box models.28 An extrinsic method is one
      that can be applied\npost-training to any model.33 Post-hoc methods found in
      the literature focus on interpreting\nmodels through 1) training data34 and
      feature attribution,35 2) surrogate models10 and, 3)\ncounterfactual9 or contrastive
      explanations.36\nOften, what is a \u201cgood\u201d explanation and what are
      the required components of an ex-\nplanation are debated.32,37,38 Palacio et
      al. 29 state that the lack of a standard framework\nhas caused the inability
      to evaluate the interpretability of a model. In physical sciences,\nwe may instead
      consider if the explanations somehow reflect and expand our understanding\nof
      physical phenomena. For example, Oviedo et al. 39 propose that a model explanation\ncan
      be evaluated by considering its agreement with physical observations, which
      they term\n\u201ccorrectness.\u201d For example, if an explanation suggests
      that polarity affects solubility of a\nmolecule, and the experimental evidence
      strengthen the hypothesis, then the explanation\nis assumed \u201ccorrect\u201d.
      In instances where such mechanistic knowledge is sparse, expert bi-\nases and
      subjectivity can be used to measure the correctness.40 Other similar metrics
      of\ncorrectness such as \u201cexplanation satisfaction scale\u201d can be found
      in the literature.41,42 In a\nrecent study, Humer et al. 43 introduced CIME
      an interactive web-based tool that allows the\nusers to inspect model explanations.
      The aim of this study is to bridge the gap between\nanalysis of XAI methods.
      Based on the above discussion, we identify that an agreed upon\n4\nevaluation
      metric is necessary in XAI. We suggest the following attributes can be used
      to\nevaluate explanations. However, the relative importance of each attribute
      may depend on\nthe application - actionability may not be as important as faithfulness
      when evaluating the\ninterpretability of a static physics based model. Therefore,
      one can select relative importance\nof each attribute based on the application.\n\u2022
      Actionable. Is it clear how we could change the input features to modify the
      output?\n\u2022 Complete. Does the explanation completely account for the prediction?
      Did features\nnot included in the explanation really contribute zero effect
      to the prediction?44\n\u2022 Correct. Does the explanation agree with hypothesized
      or known underlying physical\nmechanism?39\n\u2022 Domain Applicable. Does the
      explanation use language and concepts of domain ex-\nperts?\n\u2022 Fidelity/Faithful.
      Does the explanation ag", "lanation use language and concepts of domain ex-\nperts?\n\u2022
      Fidelity/Faithful. Does the explanation agree with the black box model?\n\u2022
      Robust. Does the explanation change significantly with small changes to the
      model or\ninstance being explained?\n\u2022 Sparse/Succinct. Is the explanation
      succinct?\nWe present an example evaluation of the SHAP explanation method based
      on the above\nattributes.44 Shapley values were proposed as a local explanation
      method based on feature\nattribution, as they offer a complete explanation -
      each feature is assigned a fraction of\nthe prediction value.44,45 Completeness
      is a clearly measurable and well-defined metric, but\nyields explanations with
      many components. Yet Shapley values are not actionable nor sparse.\nThey are
      non-sparse as every feature has a non-zero attribution and not-actionable because\nthey
      do not provide a set of features which changes the outcome.46 Ribeiro et al.
      35 proposed\na surrogate model method that aims to provide sparse/succinct explanations
      that have high\n5\nfidelity to the original model. In Wellawatte et al. 9 we
      argue that counterfactuals are \u201cbet-\nter\u201d explanations because they
      are actionable and sparse. We highlight that, evaluation of\nexplanations is
      a difficult task because explanations are fundamentally for and by humans.\nTherefore,
      these evaluations are subjective, as they depend on \u201ccomplex human factors
      and\napplication scenarios.\u201d37\nSelf-explaining models\nA self-explanatory
      model is one that is intrinsically interpretable to an expert.47 Two com-\nmon
      examples found in the literature are linear regression models and decision trees
      (DT).\nIntrinsic models can be found in other XAI applications acting as surrogate
      models (proxy\nmodels) due to their transparent nature.48,49 A linear model
      is described by the equation\n1 where, W\u2019s are the weight parameters and
      x\u2019s are the input features associated with the\nprediction \u02c6y. Therefore,
      we observe that the weights can be used to derive a complete expla-\nnation
      of the model - trained weights quantify the importance of each feature.47 DT
      models\nare another type of self-explaining models which have been used in classification
      and high-\nthroughput screening tasks. Gajewicz et al. 50 used DT models to
      classify nanomaterials\nthat identify structural features responsible for surface
      activity. In another study by Han\net al. 51, a DT model was developed to filter
      compounds by their bioactivity based on the\nchemical fingerprints.\n\u02c6y
      = \u03a3iWixi\n(1)\nRegularization techniques such as EXPO52 and RRR53 are designed
      to enhance the black-\nbox model interpretability.54 Although one can argue
      that \u201csimplicity\u201d of models are posi-\ntively correlated with interpretability,
      this is based on how the interpretability is evaluated.\nFor example, Lipton
      55 argue that, from the notion of \u201csimulatability\u201d (the degree to
      which a\nhuman can predict the outcome based on inputs), self-explanatory linear
      models, rule-based\n6\nsystems, and DT\u2019s can be claimed uninterpretable.
      A human can pred", "atory linear models, rule-based\n6\nsystems, and DT\u2019s
      can be claimed uninterpretable. A human can predict the outcome given\nthe inputs
      only if the input features are interpretable. Therefore, a linear model which
      takes\nin non-descriptive inputs may not be as transparent. On the other hand,
      a linear model\nis not innately accurate as they fail to capture non-linear
      relationships in data, limiting is\napplicability. Similarly, a DT is a rule-based
      model and lacks physics informed knowledge.\nTherefore, an existing drawback
      is the trade-off between the degree of understandability and\nthe accuracy of
      a model. For example, an intrinsic model (linear regression or decision trees)\ncan
      be described through the trainable parameters, but it may fail to \u201ccorrectly\u201d
      capture\nnon-linear relations in the data.\nAttribution methods\nFeature attribution
      methods explain black box predictions by assigning each input feature\na numerical
      value, which indicates its importance or contribution to the prediction. Feature\nattributions
      provide local explanations, but can be averaged or combined to explain multi-\nple
      instances. Atom-based numerical assignments are commonly referred to as heatmaps.56\nSheridan
      57 describes an atom-wise attribution method for interpreting QSAR models. Re-\ncently,
      Rasmussen et al. 58 showed that Crippen logP models serve as a benchmark for\nheatmap
      approaches. Other most widely used feature attribution approaches in the litera-\nture
      are gradient based methods,59,60 Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP),44 and
      layer-\nwise relevance prorogation.61\nGradient based approaches are based on
      the hypothesis that gradients for neural net-\nworks are analogous to coefficients
      for regression models.62 Class activation maps (CAM),63\ngradCAM,64 smoothGrad,,65
      and integrated gradients62 are examples of this method. The\nmain idea behind
      feature attributions with gradients can be represented with equation 2.\n\u2206\u02c6f(\u20d7x)\n\u2206xi\n\u2248\u2202\u02c6f(\u20d7x)\n\u2202xi\n(2)\n7\nwhere
      \u02c6f(x) is the black-box model and\n\u2206\u02c6f(\u20d7x)\n\u2206xi\nare
      used as our attributions. The left-\nhand side of equation 2 says that we attribute
      each input feature xi by how much one unit\nchange in it would affect the output
      of \u02c6f(x). If \u02c6f(x) is a linear surrogate model, then this\nmethod
      reconciles with LIME.35 In DL models, \u2207xf(x), suffers from the shattered
      gradients\nproblem.62 This means directly computing the quantity leads to numeric
      problems. The\ndifferent gradient based approaches are mostly distinguishable
      based on how the gradient is\napproximated.\nGradient based explanations have
      been widely used to interpret chemistry predictions.60,66\u201370\nMcCloskey
      et al. 60 used graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to predict protein-ligand\nbinding
      and explained the binding logic for these predictions using integrated gradients.\nPope
      et al. 66 and Jim\u00b4enez-Luna et al. 67 show application of gradCAM and integrated
      gradi-\nents to explain molecular property predictions from trained graph neural
      networks (GNNs).\nSanchez-Lengeling et al. 68 present compr", "rty predictions
      from trained graph neural networks (GNNs).\nSanchez-Lengeling et al. 68 present
      comprehensive, open-source XAI benchmarks to explain\nGNNs and other graph based
      models. They compare the performance of class activation\nmaps (CAM),63 gradCAM,64
      smoothGrad,,65 integrated gradients62 and attention mecha-\nnisms for explaining
      outcomes of classification as well as regression tasks. They concluded\nthat
      CAM and integrated gradients perform well for graph based models. Another attempt\nat
      creating XAI benchmarks for graph models was made by Rao et al. 70. They compared\nthese
      gradient based methods to find subgraph importance when predicting activity
      cliffs\nand concluded that gradCAM and integrated gradients provided the most
      interpretability\nfor GNNs.\nThe GNNExplainer69 is an approach for generating
      explanations (local and\nglobal) for graph based models. This method focuses
      on identifying which sub-graphs con-\ntribute most to the prediction by maximizing
      mutual information between the prediction\nand distribution of all possible
      sub-graphs. Ying et al. 69 show that GNNExplainer can be\nused to obtain model-agnostic
      explanations. SubgraphX is a similar method that explains\nGNN predictions by
      identifying important subgraphs.71\nAnother set of approaches like DeepLIFT72
      and Layerwise Relevance backPropagation73\n8\n(LRP) are based on backpropagation
      of the prediction scores through each layer of the neu-\nral network. The specific
      backpropagation logic across various activation functions differs\nin these
      approaches, which means each layer must have its own implementation. Baldas-\nsarre
      and Azizpour 74 showed application of LRP to explain aqueous solubility prediction
      for\nmolecules.\nSHAP is a model-agnostic feature attribution method that is
      inspired from the game\ntheory concept of Shapley values.44,46 SHAP has been
      popularly used in explaining molecular\nprediction models.75\u201378 It\u2019s
      an additive feature contribution approach, which assumes that\nan explanation
      model is a linear combination of binary variables z. If the Shapley value\ni
      \u03d5i(\u20d7x)zi(\u20d7x). Shapley values for\nfeatures are computed using
      Equation 3.79,80\nfor the ith feature is \u03d5i, then the explanation is \u02c6f(\u20d7x)
      = P\n\u03d5i(\u20d7x) = 1\nM\nM\nX \u02c6f (\u20d7z+i) \u2212\u02c6f (\u20d7z\u2212i)\n(3)\nHere
      \u20d7z is a fabricated example created from the original \u20d7x and a random
      perturbation \u20d7x\u2032.\n\u20d7z+i has the feature i from \u20d7x and \u20d7z\u2212i
      has the ith feature from \u20d7x\u2032. Some care should be taken\nin constructing
      \u20d7z when working with molecular descriptors to ensure that an impossible
      \u20d7z is\nnot sampled (e.g., high count of acid groups but no hydrogen bond
      donors). M is the sample\nsize of perturbations around \u20d7x. Shapley value
      computation is expensive, hence M is chosen\naccordingly. Equation 3 is an approximation
      and gives contributions with an expectation\ni=1 \u03d5i(\u20d7x) = \u02c6f(\u20d7x).\nVisualization
      based feature attribution has also been used for molecular data. In com-\nterm
      as \u03d50 + P\nputer science, saliency maps are a way to measure spatial feature
      contribution.8", "com-\nterm as \u03d50 + P\nputer science, saliency maps are
      a way to measure spatial feature contribution.81 Simply put,\nsaliency maps
      draw a connection between the model\u2019s neural fingerprint components (trained\nweights)
      and input features. Weber et al. 82 used saliency maps to build an explainable
      GCN\narchitecture that gives subgraph importance for small molecule activity
      prediction. On the\nother hand, similarity maps compare model predictions for
      two or more molecules based on\ntheir chemical fingerprints.83 Similarity maps
      provide atomic weights or predicted probabil-\n9\nity difference between the
      molecules by removing one atom at a time. These weights can\nthen be used to
      color the molecular graph and give a visual presentation. ChemInformatics\nModel
      Explorer (CIME) is an interactive web based toolkit which allows visualization
      and\ncomparison of different explanation methods for molecular property prediction
      models.84\nSurrogate models\nOne approach to explain black box predictions is
      to fit a self-explaining or interpretable\nmodel to the black box model, in
      the vicinity of one or a few specific examples. These are\nknown as surrogate
      models. Generally, one model per explanation is trained. However, if we\ncould
      find one surrogate model that explained the whole DL model, then we would simply\nhave
      a globally accurate interpretable model. This means that the black-box model
      is no\nlonger needed.79 In the work by White 79, a weighted least squares linear
      model is used as\nthe surrogate model. This model provides natural language
      based descriptor explanations by\nreplacing input features with chemically interpretable
      descriptors. This approach is similar\nto the concept-based explanations approach
      used by McGrath et al. 85, where human under-\nstandable concepts were used
      in place of input features in acquisition of chess knowledge in\nAlphaZero.
      Any of the self-explaining models detailed in the Self-explaining models section\ncan
      be used as a surrogate model.\nThe most commonly used surrogate model based
      method is Locally Interpretable Model\nExplanations (LIME).35 LIME creates perturbations
      around the example of interest and fits\nan interpretable model to these local
      perturbations. Ribeiro et al. 35 mathematically define\nan explanation \u03be
      for an example \u20d7x using Equation 4.\n\u03be(\u20d7x) = arg min\ng\u2208G
      L(f, g, \u03c0x) + \u2126(g)\n(4)\nHere f is the black box model and g \u2208G
      is the interpretable explanation model. G is\na class of potential interpretable
      models (e.g.: linear models). \u03c0x is a similarity measure\n10\nbetween original
      input \u20d7x and it\u2019s perturbed input \u20d7x\u2032. In context of molecular
      data, this can\nbe a chemical similarity metric like Tanimoto86 similarity between
      fingerprints. The goal for\nLIME is to minimize the loss, L, such that f is
      closely approximated by g. \u2126is a parameter\nthat controls the complexity
      (sparsity) of g. Ribeiro et al. 35 termed the agreement (how low\nthe loss is)
      between f and g as the \u201cfidelity\u201d.\nGraphLIME87 and LIMEtree88 are
      modifications to LIME as applica", ") between f and g as the \u201cfidelity\u201d.\nGraphLIME87
      and LIMEtree88 are modifications to LIME as applicable to graph neural\nnetworks
      and regression trees, respectively. LIME has been used in chemistry previously,\nsuch
      as Whitmore et al. 89 who used LIME to explain octane number predictions of
      molecules\nfrom a random forest classifier. Mehdi and Tiwary 90 used LIME to
      explain thermodynamic\ncontributions of features. Gandhi and White 10 use an
      approach similar to GraphLIME,\nbut use chemistry specific fragmentation and
      descriptors to explain molecular property pre-\ndiction.\nSome examples are
      highlighted in the Applications section.\nIn recent work by\nMehdi and Tiwary
      90, a thermodynamic-based surrogate model approach was used to inter-\npret
      black-box models. The authors define an \u201cinterpretation free energy\u201d
      which can be\nachieved by minimizing the surrogate model\u2019s uncertainty
      and maximizing simplicity.\nCounterfactual explanations\nCounterfactual explanations
      can be found in many fields such as statistics, mathematics and\nphilosophy.91\u201394
      According to Woodward and Hitchcock 92, a counterfactual is an example\nwith
      minimum deviation from the initial instance but with a contrasting outcome.
      They\ncan be used to answer the question, \u201cwhich smallest change could
      alter the outcome of an\ninstance of interest?\u201d While the difference between
      the two instances is based on the exis-\ntence of similar worlds in philosophy,95
      a distance metric based on molecular similarity is\nemployed in XAI for chemistry.
      For example, in the work by Wellawatte et al. 9 distance\nbetween two molecules
      is defined as the Tanimoto distance96 between ECFP4 fingerprints.97\nAdditionally,
      Mohapatra et al. 98 introduced a chemistry-informed graph representation for\ncomputing
      macromolecular similarity. Contrastive explanations are peripheral to counterfac-\n11\ntual
      explanations. Unlike the counterfactual approach, contrastive approach employ
      a dual\noptimization method, which works by generating a similar and a dissimilar
      (counterfactuals)\nexample. Contrastive explanations can interpret the model
      by identifying contribution of\npresence and absence of subsets of features
      towards a certain prediction.36,99\nA counterfactual x\u2032 of an instance
      x is one with a dissimilar prediction \u02c6f(x) in classi-\nfication tasks.
      As shown in equation 5, counterfactual generation can be thought of as a\nconstrained
      optimization problem which minimizes the vector distance d(x, x\u2032) between
      the\nfeatures.9,100\nminimize\nd(x, x\u2032)\nsuch that\n\u02c6f(x) \u0338=
      \u02c6f(x\u2032)\n(5)\nFor regression tasks, equation 6 adapted from equation
      5 can be used. Here, a counter-\nfactual is one with a defined increase or decrease
      in the prediction.\nminimize\nd(x, x\u2032)\nCounterfactuals explanations have
      become a useful tool for XAI in chemistry, as they\nsuch that\n\f\f\f \u02c6f(x)
      \u2212\u02c6f(x\u2032)\n\f\f\f \u2265\u2206\n(6)\nprovide intuitive understanding
      of predictions and are able to uncover spurious relationships\nin training data.101
      Counterfactuals create local (instance-level), actionable explan", " relationships\nin
      training data.101 Counterfactuals create local (instance-level), actionable
      explanations.\nActionability of an explanation suggest which features can be
      altered to change the outcome.\nFor example, changing a hydrophobic functional
      group in a molecule to a hydrophilic group\nto increase solubility.\nCounterfactual
      generation is a demanding task as it requires gradient optimization over\ndiscrete
      features that represents a molecule. Recent work by Fu et al. 102 and Shen et
      al. 103\npresent two techniques which allow continuous gradient-based optimization.
      Although, these\nmethodologies are shown to circumvent the issue of discrete
      molecular optimization, counter-\nfactual explanation based model interpretation
      still remains unexplored compared to other\n12\npost-hoc methods.\nCF-GNNExplainer104
      is a counterfactual explanation generating method based on GN-\nNExplainer69
      for graph data. This method generate counterfactuals by perturbing the input\ndata
      (removing edges in the graph), and keeping account of perturbations which lead
      to\nchanges in the output.\nHowever, this method is only applicable to graph-based
      models\nand can generate infeasible molecular structures. Another related work
      by Numeroso and\nBacciu 105 focus on generating counterfactual explanations
      for deep graph networks. Their\nmethod MEG (Molecular counterfactual Explanation
      Generator) uses a reinforcement learn-\ning based generator to create molecular
      counterfactuals (molecular graphs).\nWhile this\nmethod is able to generate
      counterfactuals through a multi-objective reinforcement learner,\nthis is not
      a universal approach and requires training the generator for each task.\nWork
      by Wellawatte et al. 9 present a model agnostic counterfactual generator MMACE\n(Molecular
      Model Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations) which does not require training\nor
      computing gradients. This method firstly populates a local chemical space through
      ran-\ndom string mutations of SELFIES106 molecular representations using the
      STONED algo-\nrithm.107 Next, the labels (predictions) of the molecules in the
      local space are generated\nusing the model that needs to be explained. Finally,
      the counterfactuals are identified and\nsorted by their similarities \u2013
      Tanimoto distance96 between ECFP4 fingerprints.97 Unlike the\nCF-GNNExplainer104
      and MEG105 methods, the MMACE algorithm ensures that generated\nmolecules are
      valid, owing to the surjective property of SELFIES. Additionally, the MMACE\nmethod
      can be applied to both regression and classification models. However, like most
      XAI\nmethods for molecular prediction, MMACE does not account for the chemical
      stability of\npredicted counterfactuals.\nTo circumvent this drawback, Wellawatte
      et al. 9 propose an-\nother approach, which identift counterfactuals through
      a similarity search on the PubChem\ndatabase.108\n13\nSimilarity to adjacent
      fields\nTangential examples to counterfactual explanations are adversarial training
      and matched\nmolecular pairs. Adversarial perturbations are used d", "lanations
      are adversarial training and matched\nmolecular pairs. Adversarial perturbations
      are used during training to deceive the model\nto expose the vulnerabilities
      of a model109,110 whereas counterfactuals are applied post-hoc.\nTherefore,
      the main difference between adversarial and counterfactual examples are in the\napplication,
      although both are derived from the same optimization problem.100 Grabocka\net
      al. 111 have developed a method named Adversarial Training on EXplanations (ATEX)\nwhich
      improves model robustness via exposure to adversarial examples. While there
      are\nconceptual disparities, we note that the counterfactual and adversarial
      explanations are\nequivalent mathematical objects.\nMatched molecular pairs
      (MMPs) are pairs of molecules that differ structurally at only\none site by
      a known transformation.112,113 MMPs are widely used in drug discovery and\nmedicinal
      chemistry as these facilitate fast and easy understanding of structure-activity
      re-\nlationships.114\u2013116 Counterfactuals and MMP examples intersect if
      the structural change is\nassociated with a significant change in the properties.
      In the case the associated changes in\nthe properties are non-significant, the
      two molecules are known as bioisosteres.117,118 The con-\nnection between MMPs
      and adversarial training examples has been explored by van Tilborg\net al. 119.
      MMPs which belong to the counterfactual category are commonly used in outlier\nand
      activity cliff detection.113 This approach is analogous to counterfactual explanations,\nas
      the common objective is to uncover learned knowledge pertaining to structure-property\nrelationships.70\nApplications\nModel
      interpretation is certainly not new and a common step in ML in chemistry, but
      XAI for\nDL models is becoming more important60,66\u201369,73,88,104,105 Here
      we illustrate some practical\nexamples drawn from our published work on how
      model-agnostic XAI can be utilized to\n14\ninterpret black-box models and connect
      the explanations to structure-property relationships.\nThe methods are \u201cMolecular
      Model Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations\u201d (MMACE)9\nand \u201cExplaining
      molecular properties with natural language\u201d.10 Then we demonstrate how\ncounterfactuals
      and descriptor explanations can propose structure-property relationships in\nthe
      domain of molecular scent.31\nBlood-brain barrier permeation prediction\nThe
      passive diffusion of drugs from the blood stream to the brain is a critical
      aspect in drug\ndevelopment and discovery.120 Small molecule blood-brain barrier
      (BBB) permeation is a\nclassification problem routinely assessed with DL models.121,122
      To explain why DL models\nwork, we trained two models a random forest (RF) model123
      and a Gated Recurrent Unit\nRecurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN). Then we explained
      the RF model with generated\ncounterfactuals explanations using the MMACE9 and
      the GRU-RNN with descriptor expla-\nnations.10 Both the models were trained
      on the dataset developed by Martins et al. 124. The\nRF model was implemented
      in Scikit-learn125 usi", " on the dataset developed by Martins et al. 124. The\nRF
      model was implemented in Scikit-learn125 using Mordred molecular descriptors126
      as the\ninput features. The GRU-RNN model was implemented in Keras.127 See Wellawatte
      et al. 9\nand Gandhi and White 10 for more details.\nAccording to the counterfactuals
      of the instance molecule in figure 1, we observe that the\nmodifications to
      the carboxylic acid group enable the negative example molecule to permeate\nthe
      BBB. Experimental findings by Fischer et al. 120 show that the BBB permeation
      of\nmolecules are governed by hydrophobic interactions and surface area. The
      carboxylic group is\na hydrophilic functional group which hinders hydrophobic
      interactions and addition of atoms\nenhances the surface area. This proves the
      advantage of using counterfactual explanations,\nas they suggest actionable
      modification to the molecule to make it cross the BBB.\nIn Figure 2 we show
      descriptor explanations generated for Alprozolam, a molecule that\npermeates
      the BBB, using the method described by Gandhi and White 10.\nWe see that\npredicted
      permeability is positively correlated with the aromaticity of the molecule,
      while\n15\nnegatively correlated with the number of hydrogen bonds donors and
      acceptors. A similar\nstructure-property relationship for BBB permeability is
      proposed in more mechanistic stud-\nies.128\u2013130 The substructure attributions
      indicates a reduction in hydrogen bond donors and\nacceptors. These descriptor
      explanations are quantitative and interpretable by chemists.\nFinally, we can
      use a natural language model to summarize the findings into a written\nexplanation,
      as shown in the printed text in Figure 2.\nFigure 1: Counterfactuals of a molecule
      which cannot permeate the blood-brain barrier.\nSimilarity is the Tanimoto similarity

      Society of Chemistry.\nSolubility prediction\nSmall molecule solubility prediction
      is a classic cheminformatics regression challenge and is\nimportant for chemical
      process design, drug design and crystallization.133\u2013136 In our previous\nworks,9,10
      we implemented and trained an RNN model in Keras to predict solubilities (log\nmolarity)
      of small molecules.127 The AqSolDB curated database137 was used to train the\nRNN
      model.\nIn this task, counterfactuals are based on equation 6. Figure 3 illustrates
      the generated\nlocal chemical space and the top four counterfactuals. Based
      on the counterfactuals, we ob-\nserve that the modifications to the ester group
      and other heteroatoms play an important role\nin solubility. These findings
      align with known experimental and basic chemical intuition.134\nFigure 4 shows
      a quantitative measurement of how substructures are contributing to the pre-\n16\nFigure

      that are important for the prediction. ECFP and MACCS descriptors indicate which\nsubstructures
      influence model predictions. MACCS explanations lead to text explanations\nas

      for\nMACCS descriptors were created using SMARTSviewer (smartsview.zbh.uni-hamburg.de,\nCopyright:

      For example, we see that adding acidic and basic groups as well as hydrogen
      bond\nacceptors, increases solubility. Substructure importance from ECFP97 and
      MACCS138 de-\nscriptors indicate that adding heteroatoms increases solubility,
      while adding rings structures\nmakes the molecule less soluble. Although these
      are established hypotheses, it is interesting\nto see they can be derived purely
      from the data via DL and XAI.\nFigure 3: Generated chemical space for solubility

      XAI \u2013 interpreting scent-structure relationships\nIn this example, we show
      how non-local structure-property relationships can be learned with\nXAI across
      multiple molecules. Molecular scent prediction is a multi-label classification
      task\nbecause a molecule can be described by more than one scent. For example,
      the molecule\njasmone can be described as having \u2018jasmine,\u2019 \u2018woody,\u2019
      \u2018floral,\u2019 and \u2019herbal\u2019 scents.139 The\nscent-structure relationship
      is not very well understood,140 although some relationships are\nknown. For
      example, molecules with an ester functional group are often associated with\n18\nFigure

      bars\nshow descriptors that influence predictions positively and negatively,
      respectively. Dotted\nyellow lines show significance threshold (\u03b1 = 0.05)
      for the t-statistic. The MACCS and\nECFP descriptors indicate which substructures
      influence model predictions. MACCS sub-\nstructures may either be present in
      the molecule as is or may represent a modification. ECFP\nfingerprints are substructures
      in the molecule that affect the prediction. MACCS descriptor\nare used to obtain

      a GNN model to predict the scent of molecules and utilized\ncounterfactuals9
      and descriptor explanations10 to quantify scent-structure relationships. The\nMMACE
      method was modified to account for the multi-label aspect of scent prediction.
      This\nmodification defines molecules that differed from the instance molecule
      by only the selected\nscent as counterfactuals. For instance, counterfactuals
      of the jasmone molecule would be false\nfor the \u2018jasmine\u2019 scent but
      would still be positive for \u2018woody,\u2019 \u2018floral\u2019 and \u2018herbal\u2019

      is known to have a \u2018fatty\u2019 scent, is analyzed in Fig-\nure 5.142,143
      The resulting counterfactual, which has a shorter carbon chain and no carbonyl\ngroups,
      highlights the influence of these structural features on the \u2018fatty\u2019
      scent of 2,4 deca-\ndienal. To generalize to other molecules, Seshadri et al.
      31 applied the descriptor attribution\nmethod to obtain global explanations
      for the scents. The global explanation for the \u2018fatty\u2019\nscent was
      generated by gathering chemical spaces around many \u2018fatty\u2019 scented
      molecules.\nThe resulting natural language explanation is: \u201cThe molecular
      property \u201cfatty scent\u201d can\nbe explained by the presence of a heptanyl
      fragment, two CH2 groups separated by four\n20\nbonds, and a C=O double bond,
      as well as the lack of more than one or two O atoms.\u201d31\nThe importance
      of a heptanyl fragment aligns with that reported in the literature, as \u2018fatty\u2019\nmolecules
      often have a long carbon chain.144 Furthermore, the importance of a C=O dou-\nble
      bond is supported by the findings reported by Licon et al. 145, where in addition
      to a\n\u201clarger carbon-chain skeleton\u201d, they found that \u2018fatty\u2019
      molecules also had \u201caldehyde or acid\nfunctions\u201d.145 For the \u2018pineapple\u2019
      scent, the following natural language explanation was ob-\ntained: \u201cThe
      molecular property \u201cpineapple scent\u201d can be explained by the presence
      of ester,\nethyl/ether O group, alkene/ether O group, and C=O double bond, as
      well as the absence of\nan Aromatic atom.\u201d31 Esters, such as ethyl 2-methylbutyrate,
      are present in many pineap-\nple volatile compounds.146,147 The combination
      of a C=O double bond with an ether could\nalso correspond to an ester group.
      Additionally, aldehydes and ketones, which contain C=O\ndouble bonds, are also
      common in pineapple volatile compounds.146,148\nDiscussion\nWe have shown two
      post-hoc XAI applications based on molecular counterfactual expla-\nnation",
      "scussion\nWe have shown two post-hoc XAI applications based on molecular counterfactual
      expla-\nnations9 and descriptor explanations.10 These methods can be used to
      explain black-box\nmodels whose input is a molecule. These two methods can be
      applied for both classification\nand regression tasks. Note that the \u201ccorrectness\u201d
      of the explanations strongly depends on\nthe accuracy of the black-box model.\nA
      molecular counterfactual is one with a minimal distance from a base molecular,
      but\nwith contrasting chemical properties. In the above examples, we used Tanimoto
      similar-\nity96 of ECFP4 fingreprints97 as distance, although this should be
      explored in the future.\nCounterfactual explanations are useful because they
      are represented as chemical structures\n(familiar to domain experts), sparse,
      and are actionable. A few other popular examples of\ncounterfactual on graph
      methods are GNNExplainer, MEG and CF-GNNExplainer.69,104,105\nThe descriptor
      explanation method developed by Gandhi and White 10 fits a self-explaining\n21\nsurrogate
      model to explain the black-box model. This is similar to the GraphLIME87 method,\nalthough
      we have the flexibility to use explanation features other than subgraphs. Futher-\nmore,
      we show that natural language combined with chemical descriptor attributions
      can\ncreate explanations useful for chemists, thus enhancing the accessibility
      of DL in chemistry.\nLastly, we examined if XAI can be used beyond interpretation.
      Work by Seshadri et al. 31 use\nMMACE and surrogate model explanations to analyze
      the structure-property relationships\nof scent. They recovered known structure-property
      relationships for molecular scent purely\nfrom explanations, demonstrating the
      usefulness of a two step process: fit an accurate model\nand then explain it.\nChoosing
      among the plethora of XAI methods described here is still an open question.\nIt
      remains to be seen if there will ever be a consensus benchmark, since this field
      sits on\nthe intersection of human-machine interaction, machine learning, and
      philosophy (i.e., what\nconstitutes an explanation?). Our current advice is
      to consider first the audience \u2013 domain\nexperts or ML experts or non-experts
      \u2013 and what the explanations should accomplish. Are\nthey meant to inform
      data selection or model building, how a prediction is used, or how the\nfeatures
      can be changed to affect the outcome. The second consideration is what access
      you\nhave to the underlying model. The ability to have model derivatives or
      propagate gradients\nto the input to models informs the XAI method.\nConclusion
      and outlook\nWe should seek to explain molecular property prediction models
      because users are more\nlikely to trust explained predictions, and explanations
      can help assess if the model is learning\nthe correct underlying chemical principles.
      We also showed that black-box modeling first,\nfollowed by XAI, is a path to
      structure-property relationships without needing to trade\nbetween accuracy
      and interpretability. However, XAI in chemistry has some maj", "thout needing
      to trade\nbetween accuracy and interpretability. However, XAI in chemistry has
      some major open\nquestions, that are also related to the black-box nature of
      the deep learning.\nSome are\n22\nhighlighted below:\n\u2022 Explanation representation:
      How is an explanation presented \u2013 text, a molecule, attri-\nbutions, a
      concept, etc?\n\u2022 Molecular distance: in XAI approaches such as counterfactual
      generation, the \u201cdis-\ntance\u201d between two molecules is minimized.
      Molecular distance is subjective. Possibil-\nities are distance based on molecular
      properties, synthesis routes, and direct structure\ncomparisons.\n\u2022 Regulations:
      As black-box models move from research to industry, healthcare, and\nenvironmental
      settings, we expect XAI to become more important to explain decisions\nto chemists
      or non-experts and possibly be legally required. Explanations may need\nto be
      tuned for be for doctors instead of chemists or to satisfy a legal requirement.\n\u2022
      Chemical space: Chemical space is the set of molecules that are realizable;
      \u201crealiz-\nable\u201d can be defined from purchasable to synthesizable to
      satisfied valences. What is\nmost useful? Can an explanation consider nearby
      impossible molecules? How can we\ngenerate local chemical spaces centered around
      a specific molecule for finding counter-\nfactuals or other instance explanations?
      Similarly, can \u201cactivity cliffs\u201d be connected\nto explanations and
      the local chemical space.149\n\u2022 Evaluating XAI : there is a lack of a systematic
      framework (quantitative or qualitative)\nto evaluate correctness and applicability
      of an explanation. Can there be a universal\nframework, or should explanations
      be chosen and evaluated based on the audience and\ndomain? For example, work
      by Rasmussen et al. 58 attempts to focus on comparing\nfeature attribution XAI
      methods via Crippen\u2019s logP scores.\n23\nAcknowledgements\nResearch reported

      the excerpt below to help answer a question.\n\nExcerpt from wellawatteUnknownyearaperspectiveon
      pages 14-15: Geemi P. Wellawatte, Heta A. Gandhi, Aditi Seshadri, and Andrew
      D. White. A perspective on explanations of molecular prediction models. Unknown
      journal, Unknown year. URL: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-qfv02, doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-qfv02.\n\n----\n\nlanations
      are adversarial training and matched\nmolecular pairs. Adversarial perturbations
      are used during training to deceive the model\nto expose the vulnerabilities
      of a model109,110 whereas counterfactuals are applied post-hoc.\nTherefore,
      the main difference between adversarial and counterfactual examples are in the\napplication,
      although both are derived from the same optimization problem.100 Grabocka\net
      al. 111 have developed a method named Adversarial Training on EXplanations (ATEX)\nwhich
      improves model robustness via exposure to adversarial examples. While there
      are\nconceptual disparities, we note that the counterfactual and adversarial
      explanations are\nequivalent mathematical objects.\nMatched molecular pairs
      (MMPs) are pairs of molecules that differ structurally at only\none site by
      a known transformation.112,113 MMPs are widely used in drug discovery and\nmedicinal
      chemistry as these facilitate fast and easy understanding of structure-activity
      re-\nlationships.114\u2013116 Counterfactuals and MMP examples intersect if
      the structural change is\nassociated with a significant change in the properties.
      In the case the associated changes in\nthe properties are non-significant, the
      two molecules are known as bioisosteres.117,118 The con-\nnection between MMPs
      and adversarial training examples has been explored by van Tilborg\net al. 119.
      MMPs which belong to the counterfactual category are commonly used in outlier\nand
      activity cliff detection.113 This approach is analogous to counterfactual explanations,\nas
      the common objective is to uncover learned knowledge pertaining to structure-property\nrelationships.70\nApplications\nModel
      interpretation is certainly not new and a common step in ML in chemistry, but
      XAI for\nDL models is becoming more important60,66\u201369,73,88,104,105 Here
      we illustrate some practical\nexamples drawn from our published work on how
      model-agnostic XAI can be utilized to\n14\ninterpret black-box models and connect
      the explanations to structure-property relationships.\nThe methods are \u201cMolecular
      Model Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations\u201d (MMACE)9\nand \u201cExplaining
      molecular properties with natural language\u201d.10 Then we demonstrate how\ncounterfactuals
      and descriptor explanations can propose structure-property relationships in\nthe
      domain of molecular scent.31\nBlood-brain barrier permeation prediction\nThe
      passive diffusion of drugs from the blood stream to the brain is a critical
      aspect in drug\ndevelopment and discovery.120 Small molecule blood-brain barrier
      (BBB) permeation is a\nclassification problem routinely assessed with DL models.121,122
      To explain why DL models\nwork, we trained two models a random forest (RF) model123
      and a Gated Recurrent Unit\nRecurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN). Then we explained
      the RF model with generated\ncounterfactuals explanations using the MMACE9 and
      the GRU-RNN with descriptor expla-\nnations.10 Both the models were trained
      on the dataset developed by Martins et al. 124. The\nRF model was implemented
      in Scikit-learn125 usi\n\n----\n\nQuestion: Are counterfactuals actionable?

      between f and g as the \u201cfidelity\u201d.\nGraphLIME87 and LIMEtree88 are
      modifications to LIME as applicable to graph neural\nnetworks and regression
      trees, respectively. LIME has been used in chemistry previously,\nsuch as Whitmore
      et al. 89 who used LIME to explain octane number predictions of molecules\nfrom
      a random forest classifier. Mehdi and Tiwary 90 used LIME to explain thermodynamic\ncontributions
      of features. Gandhi and White 10 use an approach similar to GraphLIME,\nbut
      use chemistry specific fragmentation and descriptors to explain molecular property
      pre-\ndiction.\nSome examples are highlighted in the Applications section.\nIn
      recent work by\nMehdi and Tiwary 90, a thermodynamic-based surrogate model approach
      was used to inter-\npret black-box models. The authors define an \u201cinterpretation
      free energy\u201d which can be\nachieved by minimizing the surrogate model\u2019s
      uncertainty and maximizing simplicity.\nCounterfactual explanations\nCounterfactual
      explanations can be found in many fields such as statistics, mathematics and\nphilosophy.91\u201394
      According to Woodward and Hitchcock 92, a counterfactual is an example\nwith
      minimum deviation from the initial instance but with a contrasting outcome.
      They\ncan be used to answer the question, \u201cwhich smallest change could
      alter the outcome of an\ninstance of interest?\u201d While the difference between
      the two instances is based on the exis-\ntence of similar worlds in philosophy,95
      a distance metric based on molecular similarity is\nemployed in XAI for chemistry.
      For example, in the work by Wellawatte et al. 9 distance\nbetween two molecules
      is defined as the Tanimoto distance96 between ECFP4 fingerprints.97\nAdditionally,
      Mohapatra et al. 98 introduced a chemistry-informed graph representation for\ncomputing
      macromolecular similarity. Contrastive explanations are peripheral to counterfac-\n11\ntual
      explanations. Unlike the counterfactual approach, contrastive approach employ
      a dual\noptimization method, which works by generating a similar and a dissimilar
      (counterfactuals)\nexample. Contrastive explanations can interpret the model
      by identifying contribution of\npresence and absence of subsets of features
      towards a certain prediction.36,99\nA counterfactual x\u2032 of an instance
      x is one with a dissimilar prediction \u02c6f(x) in classi-\nfication tasks.
      As shown in equation 5, counterfactual generation can be thought of as a\nconstrained
      optimization problem which minimizes the vector distance d(x, x\u2032) between
      the\nfeatures.9,100\nminimize\nd(x, x\u2032)\nsuch that\n\u02c6f(x) \u0338=
      \u02c6f(x\u2032)\n(5)\nFor regression tasks, equation 6 adapted from equation
      5 can be used. Here, a counter-\nfactual is one with a defined increase or decrease
      in the prediction.\nminimize\nd(x, x\u2032)\nCounterfactuals explanations have
      become a useful tool for XAI in chemistry, as they\nsuch that\n\f\f\f \u02c6f(x)
      \u2212\u02c6f(x\u2032)\n\f\f\f \u2265\u2206\n(6)\nprovide intuitive understanding

      can be altered to change the outcome.\nFor example, changing a hydrophobic functional
      group in a molecule to a hydrophilic group\nto increase solubility.\nCounterfactual
      generation is a demanding task as it requires gradient optimization over\ndiscrete
      features that represents a molecule. Recent work by Fu et al. 102 and Shen et
      al. 103\npresent two techniques which allow continuous gradient-based optimization.
      Although, these\nmethodologies are shown to circumvent the issue of discrete
      molecular optimization, counter-\nfactual explanation based model interpretation
      still remains unexplored compared to other\n12\npost-hoc methods.\nCF-GNNExplainer104
      is a counterfactual explanation generating method based on GN-\nNExplainer69
      for graph data. This method generate counterfactuals by perturbing the input\ndata
      (removing edges in the graph), and keeping account of perturbations which lead
      to\nchanges in the output.\nHowever, this method is only applicable to graph-based
      models\nand can generate infeasible molecular structures. Another related work
      by Numeroso and\nBacciu 105 focus on generating counterfactual explanations
      for deep graph networks. Their\nmethod MEG (Molecular counterfactual Explanation
      Generator) uses a reinforcement learn-\ning based generator to create molecular
      counterfactuals (molecular graphs).\nWhile this\nmethod is able to generate
      counterfactuals through a multi-objective reinforcement learner,\nthis is not
      a universal approach and requires training the generator for each task.\nWork
      by Wellawatte et al. 9 present a model agnostic counterfactual generator MMACE\n(Molecular
      Model Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations) which does not require training\nor
      computing gradients. This method firstly populates a local chemical space through
      ran-\ndom string mutations of SELFIES106 molecular representations using the
      STONED algo-\nrithm.107 Next, the labels (predictions) of the molecules in the
      local space are generated\nusing the model that needs to be explained. Finally,
      the counterfactuals are identified and\nsorted by their similarities \u2013
      Tanimoto distance96 between ECFP4 fingerprints.97 Unlike the\nCF-GNNExplainer104
      and MEG105 methods, the MMACE algorithm ensures that generated\nmolecules are
      valid, owing to the surjective property of SELFIES. Additionally, the MMACE\nmethod
      can be applied to both regression and classification models. However, like most
      XAI\nmethods for molecular prediction, MMACE does not account for the chemical
      stability of\npredicted counterfactuals.\nTo circumvent this drawback, Wellawatte
      et al. 9 propose an-\nother approach, which identift counterfactuals through
      a similarity search on the PubChem\ndatabase.108\n13\nSimilarity to adjacent
      fields\nTangential examples to counterfactual explanations are adversarial training
      and matched\nmolecular pairs. Adversarial perturbations are used d\n\n----\n\nQuestion:

      interpretations can be categorized as global or local\ninterpretations on the
      basis of \u201cwhat is being explained?\u201d. For example, counterfactuals
      are\nlocal interpretations, as these can explain only a given instance. The
      second classification is\nbased on the relation between the model and the interpretation
      \u2013 is interpretability post-hoc\n(extrinsic) or intrinsic to the model?.32,33
      An intrinsic XAI method is part of the model\nand is self-explanatory32 These
      are also referred to as white-box models to contrast them\nwith non-interpretable
      black box models.28 An extrinsic method is one that can be applied\npost-training
      to any model.33 Post-hoc methods found in the literature focus on interpreting\nmodels
      through 1) training data34 and feature attribution,35 2) surrogate models10
      and, 3)\ncounterfactual9 or contrastive explanations.36\nOften, what is a \u201cgood\u201d
      explanation and what are the required components of an ex-\nplanation are debated.32,37,38
      Palacio et al. 29 state that the lack of a standard framework\nhas caused the
      inability to evaluate the interpretability of a model. In physical sciences,\nwe
      may instead consider if the explanations somehow reflect and expand our understanding\nof
      physical phenomena. For example, Oviedo et al. 39 propose that a model explanation\ncan
      be evaluated by considering its agreement with physical observations, which
      they term\n\u201ccorrectness.\u201d For example, if an explanation suggests
      that polarity affects solubility of a\nmolecule, and the experimental evidence
      strengthen the hypothesis, then the explanation\nis assumed \u201ccorrect\u201d.
      In instances where such mechanistic knowledge is sparse, expert bi-\nases and
      subjectivity can be used to measure the correctness.40 Other similar metrics
      of\ncorrectness such as \u201cexplanation satisfaction scale\u201d can be found
      in the literature.41,42 In a\nrecent study, Humer et al. 43 introduced CIME
      an interactive web-based tool that allows the\nusers to inspect model explanations.
      The aim of this study is to bridge the gap between\nanalysis of XAI methods.
      Based on the above discussion, we identify that an agreed upon\n4\nevaluation
      metric is necessary in XAI. We suggest the following attributes can be used
      to\nevaluate explanations. However, the relative importance of each attribute
      may depend on\nthe application - actionability may not be as important as faithfulness
      when evaluating the\ninterpretability of a static physics based model. Therefore,
      one can select relative importance\nof each attribute based on the application.\n\u2022
      Actionable. Is it clear how we could change the input features to modify the
      output?\n\u2022 Complete. Does the explanation completely account for the prediction?
      Did features\nnot included in the explanation really contribute zero effect
      to the prediction?44\n\u2022 Correct. Does the explanation agree with hypothesized
      or known underlying physical\nmechanism?39\n\u2022 Domain Applicable. Does the
      explanation use language and concepts of domain ex-\nperts?\n\u2022 Fidelity/Faithful.

      use language and concepts of domain ex-\nperts?\n\u2022 Fidelity/Faithful. Does
      the explanation agree with the black box model?\n\u2022 Robust. Does the explanation
      change significantly with small changes to the model or\ninstance being explained?\n\u2022
      Sparse/Succinct. Is the explanation succinct?\nWe present an example evaluation
      of the SHAP explanation method based on the above\nattributes.44 Shapley values
      were proposed as a local explanation method based on feature\nattribution, as
      they offer a complete explanation - each feature is assigned a fraction of\nthe
      prediction value.44,45 Completeness is a clearly measurable and well-defined
      metric, but\nyields explanations with many components. Yet Shapley values are
      not actionable nor sparse.\nThey are non-sparse as every feature has a non-zero
      attribution and not-actionable because\nthey do not provide a set of features
      which changes the outcome.46 Ribeiro et al. 35 proposed\na surrogate model method
      that aims to provide sparse/succinct explanations that have high\n5\nfidelity
      to the original model. In Wellawatte et al. 9 we argue that counterfactuals
      are \u201cbet-\nter\u201d explanations because they are actionable and sparse.
      We highlight that, evaluation of\nexplanations is a difficult task because explanations
      are fundamentally for and by humans.\nTherefore, these evaluations are subjective,
      as they depend on \u201ccomplex human factors and\napplication scenarios.\u201d37\nSelf-explaining
      models\nA self-explanatory model is one that is intrinsically interpretable
      to an expert.47 Two com-\nmon examples found in the literature are linear regression
      models and decision trees (DT).\nIntrinsic models can be found in other XAI
      applications acting as surrogate models (proxy\nmodels) due to their transparent
      nature.48,49 A linear model is described by the equation\n1 where, W\u2019s
      are the weight parameters and x\u2019s are the input features associated with
      the\nprediction \u02c6y. Therefore, we observe that the weights can be used
      to derive a complete expla-\nnation of the model - trained weights quantify
      the importance of each feature.47 DT models\nare another type of self-explaining
      models which have been used in classification and high-\nthroughput screening
      tasks. Gajewicz et al. 50 used DT models to classify nanomaterials\nthat identify
      structural features responsible for surface activity. In another study by Han\net
      al. 51, a DT model was developed to filter compounds by their bioactivity based
      on the\nchemical fingerprints.\n\u02c6y = \u03a3iWixi\n(1)\nRegularization techniques
      such as EXPO52 and RRR53 are designed to enhance the black-\nbox model interpretability.54
      Although one can argue that \u201csimplicity\u201d of models are posi-\ntively
      correlated with interpretability, this is based on how the interpretability
      is evaluated.\nFor example, Lipton 55 argue that, from the notion of \u201csimulatability\u201d
      (the degree to which a\nhuman can predict the outcome based on inputs), self-explanatory
      linear models, rule-based\n6\nsystems, and DT\u2019s can be claimed uninterpretable.

      pages 21-22: Geemi P. Wellawatte, Heta A. Gandhi, Aditi Seshadri, and Andrew
      D. White. A perspective on explanations of molecular prediction models. Unknown
      journal, Unknown year. URL: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-qfv02, doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-qfv02.\n\n----\n\nscussion\nWe
      have shown two post-hoc XAI applications based on molecular counterfactual expla-\nnations9
      and descriptor explanations.10 These methods can be used to explain black-box\nmodels
      whose input is a molecule. These two methods can be applied for both classification\nand
      regression tasks. Note that the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of the explanations
      strongly depends on\nthe accuracy of the black-box model.\nA molecular counterfactual
      is one with a minimal distance from a base molecular, but\nwith contrasting
      chemical properties. In the above examples, we used Tanimoto similar-\nity96
      of ECFP4 fingreprints97 as distance, although this should be explored in the
      future.\nCounterfactual explanations are useful because they are represented
      as chemical structures\n(familiar to domain experts), sparse, and are actionable.
      A few other popular examples of\ncounterfactual on graph methods are GNNExplainer,
      MEG and CF-GNNExplainer.69,104,105\nThe descriptor explanation method developed
      by Gandhi and White 10 fits a self-explaining\n21\nsurrogate model to explain
      the black-box model. This is similar to the GraphLIME87 method,\nalthough we
      have the flexibility to use explanation features other than subgraphs. Futher-\nmore,
      we show that natural language combined with chemical descriptor attributions
      can\ncreate explanations useful for chemists, thus enhancing the accessibility
      of DL in chemistry.\nLastly, we examined if XAI can be used beyond interpretation.
      Work by Seshadri et al. 31 use\nMMACE and surrogate model explanations to analyze
      the structure-property relationships\nof scent. They recovered known structure-property
      relationships for molecular scent purely\nfrom explanations, demonstrating the
      usefulness of a two step process: fit an accurate model\nand then explain it.\nChoosing
      among the plethora of XAI methods described here is still an open question.\nIt
      remains to be seen if there will ever be a consensus benchmark, since this field
      sits on\nthe intersection of human-machine interaction, machine learning, and
      philosophy (i.e., what\nconstitutes an explanation?). Our current advice is
      to consider first the audience \u2013 domain\nexperts or ML experts or non-experts
      \u2013 and what the explanations should accomplish. Are\nthey meant to inform
      data selection or model building, how a prediction is used, or how the\nfeatures
      can be changed to affect the outcome. The second consideration is what access
      you\nhave to the underlying model. The ability to have model derivatives or
      propagate gradients\nto the input to models informs the XAI method.\nConclusion
      and outlook\nWe should seek to explain molecular property prediction models
      because users are more\nlikely to trust explained predictions, and explanations
      can help assess if the model is learning\nthe correct underlying chemical principles.
      We also showed that black-box modeling first,\nfollowed by XAI, is a path to
      structure-property relationships without needing to trade\nbetween accuracy
      and interpretability. However, XAI in chemistry has some maj\n\n----\n\nQuestion:

      on the dataset developed by Martins et al. 124. The\nRF model was implemented
      in Scikit-learn125 using Mordred molecular descriptors126 as the\ninput features.
      The GRU-RNN model was implemented in Keras.127 See Wellawatte et al. 9\nand
      Gandhi and White 10 for more details.\nAccording to the counterfactuals of the
      instance molecule in figure 1, we observe that the\nmodifications to the carboxylic
      acid group enable the negative example molecule to permeate\nthe BBB. Experimental
      findings by Fischer et al. 120 show that the BBB permeation of\nmolecules are
      governed by hydrophobic interactions and surface area. The carboxylic group
      is\na hydrophilic functional group which hinders hydrophobic interactions and
      addition of atoms\nenhances the surface area. This proves the advantage of using
      counterfactual explanations,\nas they suggest actionable modification to the
      molecule to make it cross the BBB.\nIn Figure 2 we show descriptor explanations
      generated for Alprozolam, a molecule that\npermeates the BBB, using the method
      described by Gandhi and White 10.\nWe see that\npredicted permeability is positively
      correlated with the aromaticity of the molecule, while\n15\nnegatively correlated
      with the number of hydrogen bonds donors and acceptors. A similar\nstructure-property
      relationship for BBB permeability is proposed in more mechanistic stud-\nies.128\u2013130
      The substructure attributions indicates a reduction in hydrogen bond donors
      and\nacceptors. These descriptor explanations are quantitative and interpretable
      by chemists.\nFinally, we can use a natural language model to summarize the
      findings into a written\nexplanation, as shown in the printed text in Figure
      2.\nFigure 1: Counterfactuals of a molecule which cannot permeate the blood-brain

      prediction\nSmall molecule solubility prediction is a classic cheminformatics
      regression challenge and is\nimportant for chemical process design, drug design
      and crystallization.133\u2013136 In our previous\nworks,9,10 we implemented
      and trained an RNN model in Keras to predict solubilities (log\nmolarity) of
      small molecules.127 The AqSolDB curated database137 was used to train the\nRNN
      model.\nIn this task, counterfactuals are based on equation 6. Figure 3 illustrates
      the generated\nlocal chemical space and the top four counterfactuals. Based
      on the counterfactuals, we ob-\nserve that the modifications to the ester group
      and other heteroatoms play an important role\nin solubility. These findings
      align with known experimental and basic chemical intuition.134\nFigure 4 shows
      a quantitative measurement of how substructures are contributing to the pre-\n16\nFigure

      Hamburg) de-\nveloped by Schomburg et al. 132.\n19\nthe \u2018fruity\u2019 scent.
      There are some exceptions though, like tert-amyl acetate which has a\n\u2018camphoraceous\u2019
      rather than \u2018fruity\u2019 scent.140,141\nIn Seshadri et al. 31, we trained
      a GNN model to predict the scent of molecules and utilized\ncounterfactuals9
      and descriptor explanations10 to quantify scent-structure relationships. The\nMMACE
      method was modified to account for the multi-label aspect of scent prediction.
      This\nmodification defines molecules that differed from the instance molecule
      by only the selected\nscent as counterfactuals. For instance, counterfactuals
      of the jasmone molecule would be false\nfor the \u2018jasmine\u2019 scent but
      would still be positive for \u2018woody,\u2019 \u2018floral\u2019 and \u2018herbal\u2019
      scents.\nFigure 5: Counterfactual for the 2,4 decadienal molecule.\nThe counterfactual
      indicates\nstructural changes to ethyl benzoate that would result in the model
      predicting the molecule\nto not contain the \u2018fruity\u2019 scent. The Tanimoto96
      similarity between the counterfactual and\n2,4 decadienal is also provided.
      Republished with permission from authors.31\nThe molecule 2,4-decadienal, which
      is known to have a \u2018fatty\u2019 scent, is analyzed in Fig-\nure 5.142,143
      The resulting counterfactual, which has a shorter carbon chain and no carbonyl\ngroups,
      highlights the influence of these structural features on the \u2018fatty\u2019
      scent of 2,4 deca-\ndienal. To generalize to other molecules, Seshadri et al.
      31 applied the descriptor attribution\nmethod to obtain global explanations
      for the scents. The global explanation for the \u2018fatty\u2019\nscent was
      generated by gathering chemical spaces around many \u2018fatty\u2019 scented
      molecules.\nThe resulting natural language explanation is: \u201cThe molecular
      property \u201cfatty scent\u201d can\nbe explained by the presence of a heptanyl
      fragment, two CH2 groups separated by four\n20\nbonds, and a C=O double bond,
      as well as the lack of more than one or two O atoms.\u201d31\nThe importance
      of a heptanyl fragment aligns with that reported in the literature, as \u2018fatty\u2019\nmolecules
      often have a long carbon chain.144 Furthermore, the importance of a C=O dou-\nble
      bond is supported by the findings reported by Licon et al. 145, where in addition
      to a\n\u201clarger carbon-chain skeleton\u201d, they found that \u2018fatty\u2019
      molecules also had \u201caldehyde or acid\nfunctions\u201d.145 For the \u2018pineapple\u2019
      scent, the following natural language explanation was ob-\ntained: \u201cThe
      molecular property \u201cpineapple scent\u201d can be explained by the presence
      of ester,\nethyl/ether O group, alkene/ether O group, and C=O double bond, as
      well as the absence of\nan Aromatic atom.\u201d31 Esters, such as ethyl 2-methylbutyrate,
      are present in many pineap-\nple volatile compounds.146,147 The combination
      of a C=O double bond with an ether could\nalso correspond to an ester group.
      Additionally, aldehydes and ketones, which contain C=O\ndouble bonds, are also
      common in pineapple volatile compounds.146,148\nDiscussion\nWe have shown two

      pages 11-12: Counterfactual explanations are described as actionable in the
      context of XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) for chemistry. They are
      used to determine \"which smallest change could alter the outcome of an instance
      of interest,\" indicating their actionable nature. The excerpt explains that
      counterfactuals are generated by minimizing the vector distance \\(d(x, x'')\\)
      between features, subject to a change in prediction \\(\\hat{f}(x) \\neq \\hat{f}(x'')\\)
      for classification tasks, and \\(|\\hat{f}(x) - \\hat{f}(x'')| \\geq \\Delta\\)
      for regression tasks. This suggests that counterfactuals provide \"intuitive
      understanding of predictions\" and can uncover spurious relationships, making
      them actionable at the instance level.\n\n9\nFrom Geemi P. Wellawatte, Heta

      15-17: The excerpt provides evidence that counterfactuals are actionable. It
      states that modifications to the carboxylic acid group in a molecule can enable
      it to permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as counterfactual explanations
      suggest actionable changes to enhance permeability. Specifically, the addition
      of atoms increases surface area, overcoming the hydrophilic nature of the carboxylic
      group, which hinders hydrophobic interactions necessary for BBB permeation.
      Additionally, in solubility prediction, counterfactuals indicate that modifications
      to the ester group and heteroatoms are crucial, aligning with experimental findings
      and chemical intuition. These examples demonstrate the practical applicability
      of counterfactuals in molecular modifications.\n\n9\nFrom Geemi P. Wellawatte,

      5-7: The excerpt discusses the evaluation of explanation methods for molecular
      prediction models, focusing on attributes like fidelity, robustness, and sparsity.
      It mentions that Shapley values, while providing a complete explanation, are
      not actionable because they do not offer a set of features that change the outcome.
      In contrast, the authors argue that counterfactuals are \"better\" explanations
      because they are both actionable and sparse. This suggests that counterfactuals
      provide actionable insights by identifying specific changes that can alter the
      prediction outcome, making them useful for decision-making processes.\n\n9\nFrom

      actionable explanations.\" The actionability of a counterfactual explanation
      is demonstrated by suggesting which features can be altered to change the outcome,
      such as modifying a hydrophobic functional group in a molecule to a hydrophilic
      one to increase solubility. The excerpt discusses various methods for generating
      counterfactuals, including CF-GNNExplainer, MEG, and MMACE, each with different
      approaches and limitations. Despite these methods, the excerpt notes that counterfactual
      explanation-based model interpretation is less explored compared to other post-hoc
      methods.\n\n8\nFrom Geemi P. Wellawatte, Heta A. Gandhi, Aditi Seshadri, and

      35-36: The excerpt references several works related to counterfactual explanations,
      which are a method for providing interpretability in AI models. Specifically,  discuss
      counterfactual explanations in the context of automated decisions and the General
      Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), suggesting their potential role in legal
      accountability.  and Numeroso & Bacciu (2020) explore counterfactual explanations
      for Graph Neural Networks, indicating their applicability in complex model interpretability.
      Freiesleben (2022) examines the relationship between counterfactual explanations
      and adversarial examples, which may imply actionability in terms of model robustness
      and decision-making.\n\n8\nFrom Geemi P. Wellawatte, Heta A. Gandhi, Aditi Seshadri,
